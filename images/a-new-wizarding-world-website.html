the new home of the Wizarding World. Come in, grab a cup of tea (or Butterbeer, if you prefer) and take a look around…</section></div><div class="ArticleNewsFeature_sectionContainer__2JHdz"><section class="ArticleCopy_articleCopy__g2xm_"><p>So, here we are. The Wizarding World has expanded and, as such, Pottermore.com has a new, bigger home for all of the magic you love. From the team that brought you Pottermore, along with some new friends too, WizardingWorld.com is the new online home of Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts.</p>
<h2>This is just the beginning</h2>
<p>It’s like a more polished, shiny version of The Burrow... we’ve magically added a few extra floors to our house and thrown in some Extension Charms, brought over the content you know and love from Pottermore.com, and added some new, enhanced experiences. What’s more, everyone – no matter their age – can come and have a look around.</p>
</section></div><div class="ArticleNewsFeature_sectionContainer__2JHdz"><section class="ArticleCopy_articleCopy__g2xm_"><p>Here you can delve deeper into J.K. Rowling’s stories with articles on wizarding world themes, from a broad range of authors offering their thoughts; test your knowledge with a range of quizzes; enjoy exclusive new videos, and get up to speed with the latest Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts news.</p>
<p>We’re still moving in and unpacking a few boxes – so there are more surprises to be unveiled soon.‬ ‬‬‬No rogue Doxys to be found anywhere, we hope.</p>
<p>And as we built a new home, we’ve also built...</p>
<h2>A reimagined Sorting Ceremony</h2>
<p>Take a seat – a three-legged stool would be perfect – and discover where you truly belong with a reimagining of the <a href="https://my.wizardingworld.com/sorting-hat">Sorting Ceremony.</a></p>
<p>Please do not worry. We’re not going to prise your beloved Hogwarts houses away from you! We’re offering a fresh way to get sorted with a beautiful new design, featuring J.K. Rowling’s original questions from Pottermore.com.</p>
<p>Give it a go and share your ‪#‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬HousePride. If you’re on Instagram, you can get an exclusive Instagram frame themed around whichever‬ Hogwarts house calls to you‬‬.</p>
<p>Find the reimagined <a href="https://my.wizardingworld.com/sorting-hat">Sorting Ceremony right here.</a> If our Wizarding World app has already launched in your country, you can try out a more interactive version on mobile – which includes a few extra treats along the way as you answer those all-important questions. ‬‬</p>
<p>And while we’re talking about the app…</p>
<h2>The official Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts companion</h2>
<p>We recently launched our new Wizarding World app in the UK, US and Ireland – along with previous countries Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The app (which is free, so no pennies required) holds many surprises, such as secret code unlocks and the new fanzine we’re calling Wizarding Weekly. We hope you like it – watch out for the app rolling out in more countries soon.</p>
<h2>Anything else?</h2>
<p>Always. But bear with us: more will be revealed soon enough. For now, have a look around, and make sure to grab a biscuit on your way out. We hope you like what we’ve done with the place.</p>

Percy Weasley\n\n__Coolest moment:__ ‘Hello, Minister!’ …. ‘Did I mention I’m resigning?’\n\n__Verdict:__ We’re absolutely not saying you can’t be cool and be a Prefect, but Percy wasn’t exactly the most gracious of authority figures. He regularly threatened Ron with detention, and liked to remind everyone exactly what his title was – whether that be Prefect or Head Boy. And after he left Hogwarts and joined the Ministry, it was very not cool to be in league with Fudge and Umbridge and turn his back on his family. He definitely redeemed himself in the end, and the moment he announced his resignation in a duel was fantastic, but unfortunately that wasn't enough to tip the balance of Percy ending up at the bottom of the pile in the coolest Weasley child rankings.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 6. Ron Weasley\n\n__Coolest moment:__ ‘Weasley can save anything, He never leaves a single ring, That’s why Gryffindors all sing: Weasley is our King.’\n\n__Verdict:__ Ron had a tough time staying cool under pressure, and we don’t blame him: three-headed dogs, giant spiders, Azkaban escapees – he really did have a lot to deal with during his time at Hogwarts. The great thing about Ron was that he had true courage – he was often afraid but conquered his fear and fought for good anyway. Unfortunately, that meant he wasn’t always exactly cool – remember those slugs? And it was supremely uncool of him to abandon Harry and Hermione on their Horcrux hunt. That being said, he did have some pretty cool moments – saving Harry from freezing water and destroying a Horcrux, that epic chess game in Philosophers Stone – but we picked the moment that the song – started as a taunt by the Slytherins – was taken over by Gryffindors to reflect Ron’s Quidditch Keeping success.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 5. Charlie Weasley\n\n__Coolest moment:__ ‘How are you? Thanks for the letter – I’d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.’\n\n__Verdict:__ This quote is taken from a letter Charlie wrote to Ron, who had asked him for help with Hagrid’s pet dragon. Pretty cool of an elder brother not to question this odd request, and ever cooler just to be able to just casually mention that you have friends who can help out with a Norwegian Ridgeback! Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see too much of Charlie, although we heard all about him working with dragons in Romania (also a very cool job!). He isn’t much higher on the rankings as we just can’t judge how cool he really was from the information we have – however according to Fred he did have to take his Apparition test twice because he ‘Apparated five miles south of where he meant to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping, remember?’ Not cool, Charlie. Not cool.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 4. George Weasley\n\n__Coolest moment:__ ‘Saint-like,’ repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. ‘You see ... I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?’\n\n__Verdict:__ Even after losing his ear, this Weasley twin was cracking jokes and trying to make everyone laugh – can you get any cooler than that? That being said, the rankings are getting pretty close together on the cool factor front as we reach the twins – though they did many of their coolest deeds together, so we’ve penalised them slightly for that (remember giving Harry the Marauder’s Map? Umbridge and the fireworks? Leaving that swamp in a corridor at Hogwarts with no instructions for how to get rid of it?). Legends.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 3. Fred Weasley\n\n__Coolest moment:__ ‘George,’ said Fred, ‘I think we’ve outgrown full-time education.’\n\n__Verdict:__ Fred just edges ahead of his twin brother in these rankings, as he is often the ring-leader of the two. He’s usually the one with the witty one-liners, and therefore comes across as ‘cooler’ in his confidence – the quote above is said directly to Umbridge before they leave Hogwarts behind on their broomsticks. He’s also often the instigator – for example, he was the one driving the flying car in Chamber of Secrets, and it was his idea to use an Ageing Potion to try to enter their names in the Goblet of Fire. You might not think that makes him cooler – but we had to decide whether Gred or Forge came higher in the rankings somehow! If you want to find out more about the differences between Fred and George, you can read an article we wrote about them [here.](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/differences-between-fred-and-george-weasley) \n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 2. Ginny Weasley\n\n__Coolest moment:__ ‘The thing about growing up with Fred and George,’ said Ginny thoughtfully, ‘is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve.’\n\n__Verdict:__ Ginny almost makes it to the top of the Weasley rankings for coolness. She trained herself at Quidditch when her brothers never let her play, she had the meanest Bat Bogey Hex around (and wasn’t afraid to use it), and continued to cause havoc at Hogwarts to rebel against the Death Eaters in Deathly Hallows. She befriended Luna Lovegood, and stuck up for her, even though she wasn’t exactly the coolest Hogwarts student around, and when asked if Harry had a tattoo, completely styled it out and told everyone it was a Hungarian Horntail. Need we go on?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 1. Bill Weasley\n\n__Coolest moment:__ ‘However, Bill was – there was no other word for it – cool.’\n\n__Verdict:__ He was always going to win this one, wasn’t he? He was a curse-breaker for Gringotts – how cool does that sound? And that was after being Head Boy and getting about a million OWLs, as well as sporting that ponytail and fang earring. This kind of pirate-style coolness was evident in something he said to Mrs Weasley when she was fussing over his appearance: ‘Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure,’ – so casual. Not to mention he married someone equally as cool and attractive as himself – Fleur Delacour – who was a Triwizard Champion and half-Veela. If that wasn’t enough, he took being attacked by Fenrir Greyback completely in his stride: … ‘in personality he seemed just the same as ever. All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks.’ Bill, we bow to your superior coolness."}],"tags":[{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:07:02.831000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"L1Cef6BUiA2eC84VPklgq","name":"hide-from-app"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:06:54.732000","authorComment":"This excludes the content item from its index page i.e. quizzes run to Quiz section automatically, but for other Quiz content (publishing elsewhere) it excludes from Discover.

The first Dursley to learn of magic, of course, was not a Dursley at all. It was Petunia Evans, before she married into the Dursley name. She was a child when sister Lily – later to be Harry Potter’s mother – revealed herself to be a witch, and her reaction was a mixture of jealousy and spite. For instance, when Lily received her letter from Hogwarts, Petunia wrote to Dumbledore to ask if she could go, too. Despite his kindly reply saying no, Petunia then grew resentful of the wizarding world, and regarded witches and wizards as freaks.\n\nYears later – after her sister was killed, and Harry was left in her care – this resentment would carry over into her marriage with Vernon Dursley, who shared her views on all things that weren’t ‘normal’. The Dursleys, as you may know, were big fans of being normal, and tried their hardest to shut out everything they regarded as not. This translated into contempt for Harry, who was a daily reminder of the world beyond their own – one which they both feared, and didn’t understand.\n\nSharing this resentment was their son, Dudley, a bully who tormented his cousin until he learned of his magical abilities. What followed then was fear, eventually tempered when Dudley found out that Harry was not allowed to do magic outside of Hogwarts. Unlike his parents, however, Dudley’s attitude towards Harry would soften over the years – inspired largely by Harry saving his cousin from Dementors in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,* a moment that would change Dudley profoundly.\n\nWhen parting ways in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, Dudley even thanked Harry and said: ‘I don’t think you’re a waste of space.’\n\n## Mr and Mrs Granger"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T18:54:00.320000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"1nW3deuiXWQEWAYGQKQoCm-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-HermioneGranger WB F7 HermioneInHerBedroom Still 080615 Land 5CsktElzIAE6SQMMOycuQ-b1","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:19:00.736000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"1nW3deuiXWQEWAYGQKQoCm","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":2496,"width":3743},"size":1184874},"fileName":"HermioneGranger_WB_F7_HermioneInHerBedroom_Still_080615_Land.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/1nW3deuiXWQEWAYGQKQoCm/f217cbdfe7f7b0213f8a8b87d63d8f35/HermioneGranger_WB_F7_HermioneInHerBedroom_Still_080615_Land.jpg"},"title":"HermioneGranger WB F7 HermioneInHerBedroom Still 080615 Land"},"imageAltText":"Hermione in her bedroom","imageCaption":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:00:33.111000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"5QT08dlsCQ8I6CwmKQMIYe-b4","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-BODY-OF-muggles-who-are-in-on-the-wizarding-secret-4","text":"Almost the total opposite of the Dursleys are Hermione’s Muggle parents, the Grangers. Mr and Mrs Granger – we’re never told their first names – were introduced to the wizarding world in much the same way that most Muggles are: they received a letter from Hogwarts, which revealed their daughter to be a Muggle-born witch. According to Hermione, the news came as a surprise, but her parents were supportive. In *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,* the pair were said to be nervous about being in Diagon Alley, but soon struck up a lasting friendship with the Weasley family. Especially Arthur Weasley, who was fascinated by their Muggle ways.\n\nExposing Muggles to the wizarding world is not without its dangers, however. On that same trip to Diagon Alley, the Grangers came face-to-face with its uglier side when they bumped into Lucius Malfoy, a pure-blood supremacist who insulted them to their face. This provoked a fight with Arthur, which left the Grangers ‘shaking with fright’. And of course, there is their most dangerous brush with magic: when Hermione was forced to erase their memories in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,* lest they were captured and tortured by Death Eaters.\n\n## James Steward"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T17:50:48.945000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"3CQ9zPF5jGUKy4YSGgea6a-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-Ilvermorny Wizarding Map News Hub 1QjgZONudCWkgm6WuaceG8","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T06:18:30.861000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"3CQ9zPF5jGUKy4YSGgea6a","description":"Ilvermorny Wizarding Map News Hub","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":1143,"width":2544},"size":2019230},"fileName":"Wizarding-School-Map-Ilvermorny.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/3CQ9zPF5jGUKy4YSGgea6a/6eb3245faaa44e8f9cc70bc76068068b/Wizarding-School-Map-Ilvermorny.jpg"},"title":"Ilvermorny Wizarding Map News Hub"},"imageAltText":"Ilvermorny Wizarding Map News Hub"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-02T06:39:49.692000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"5QT08dlsCQ8I6CwmKQMIYe-b6","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-BODY-OF-muggles-who-are-in-on-the-wizarding-secret-6","text":"One of the most romantic Muggle/wizard relationships in history, however, was between Isolt Sayre, one of the founders of American wizarding school [Ilvermorny](/writing-by-jk-rowling/ilvermorny), and her No-Maj husband James Steward. \n\nThe pair met after arriving in America, with Isolt fleeing her wicked Irish aunt, Gormlaith Gaunt, and James emigrating over with the Plymouth settlement. It was a meeting defined by tragedy, with both Isolt and James having come across a wizarding family attacked by a Hidebehind. With the parents dead, they took it upon themselves to nurse the surviving children, Chadwick and Webster, back to health.\n\nAccording to J.K. Rowling, James was initially scared of magic, but each day his fear subsided. This complicated things for Isolt, who vowed that she was going to Obliviate James’s memory and send him back to Plymouth, but grew fond of having him around. ‘Finally,’ J.K. Rowling wrote, ‘it seemed simplest to admit that they were in love, marry and have done with it.’\n\nJames Steward would go on to play a huge role in the wizarding world: probably bigger than any Muggle or No-Maj has since. Along with Isolt, and their adoptive children Chadwick and Webster, James would co-found Ilvermorny – the very first American school for witches and wizards – and become its joint Headmaster, alongside Isolt. To this day, marble statues of James and his wife flank the front doors of Ilvermorny Castle, ‘one of the most democratic, least elitist of all the great wizarding schools,’ writes Rowling.\n\n## Tom Riddle Sr"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T18:40:21.375000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"p6L4RtBTVeAKCO8O8ACkm-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-TheRiddleHouse PM B4C1M1 RiddleHouseExteriorAtNight Moment 5qw0xpbFhmKEA2guOGI8q0-b11","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:41:55.302000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"p6L4RtBTVeAKCO8O8ACkm","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":1885,"width":5178},"size":826794},"fileName":"TheRiddleHouse_PM_B4C1M1_RiddleHouseExteriorAtNight_Moment.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/p6L4RtBTVeAKCO8O8ACkm/118bbbf1ffd426817f1816bf8fea1635/TheRiddleHouse_PM_B4C1M1_RiddleHouseExteriorAtNight_Moment.jpg"},"title":"TheRiddleHouse PM B4C1M1 RiddleHouseExteriorAtNight Moment"},"imageAltText":"The outside of the Riddle's house at night from the Goblet of Fire.","imageCaption":"© JKR/Pottermore Ltd. ™ Warner Bros."},{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:00:47.461000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"5QT08dlsCQ8I6CwmKQMIYe-b8","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-BODY-OF-muggles-who-are-in-on-the-wizarding-secret-8","text":"If Isolt Sayre and James Steward were wizarding history’s most romantic half-blood romance, then the story of Lord Voldemort’s parents – Merope Gaunt and her Muggle husband, Tom Riddle Senior – was one of its least.\n\nThe story goes that Merope, an abused witch living in poverty, harboured a burning passion for Riddle: a Muggle who was already in love with another Muggle, and who mocked the Gaunt family. Yet that all changed suddenly; Riddle ditched his Muggle companion, and – seemingly out of nowhere – fell in love with Merope instead. Why? In *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Albus Dumbledore theorised that Merope sneaked Riddle a love potion, rendering him infatuated with her. Merope soon fell pregnant with Tom Riddle Junior, but his father left before he was born.\n\nYears later, Lord Voldemort would say that his Muggle father abandoned his mother after finding out that she was a witch. But Dumbledore had another theory: ‘I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby’s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts.’\n\nIn support of Dumbledore’s theory, it’s said that Tom Riddle Senior returned home talking about how he had been ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in’. Whether this was him alluding to magic – indeed, it’s unclear how much he knew, or remembered – is unclear, but it’s possible that he just didn’t want to come across as insane. Regardless, he was later murdered by his own son.\n\n## The Muggle Prime Minister\n\nLast but certainly not least is one of the most powerful Muggles of all: the British Prime Minister. As if the job wasn’t tough enough already, it’s said that on the night a Prime Minister is elected, they receive a visit from ‘the other Minister’: the Minister for Magic. It’s here that they’re informed of a world beyond their own, that witches and wizards live in secret among them, and that they have their own form of government to make sure that both worlds are kept safe from one another. According to Cornelius Fudge, the man who was Prime Minister during the events of the Harry Potter series took the news rather well; or, at least, he took it better than his predecessor, who thought the whole thing was a hoax by the opposition, and tried to throw Fudge out of a window."},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T18:54:59.322000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"4XfSHMsy9GUswO6IAoIWuK-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-WB F5 Cornelius Fudge at Ministry Harry's hearing HP5D-7362 5QT08dlsCQ8I6CwmKQMIYe-b9","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:29:42.159000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"4XfSHMsy9GUswO6IAoIWuK","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":4096,"width":6144},"size":2997153},"fileName":"WB F5 Cornelius Fudge at Ministry Harry's hearing HP5D-7362.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/4XfSHMsy9GUswO6IAoIWuK/72d08f2af981e35457c37227c975a146/WB_F5_Cornelius_Fudge_at_Ministry_Harry_s_hearing_HP5D-7362.jpg"},"title":"WB F5 Cornelius Fudge at Ministry Harry's hearing HP5D-7362"},"imageCaption":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:00:46.377000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"5QT08dlsCQ8I6CwmKQMIYe-b10","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-BODY-OF-muggles-who-are-in-on-the-wizarding-secret-10","text":"When Fudge first introduced himself to the Prime Minister of the Harry Potter series (his name is unknown, as is whether or not he’s based on the real-life Prime Minister of 1990-1997, John Major), he told him, ‘Not to worry. It’s odds on you’ll never see me again. I’ll only bother you if there’s something really serious going on our end, something that’s likely to affect the Muggles – the non-magical population, I should say.’\n\nBut that wasn’t the case. Over the next few years, Fudge would visit him with a variety of wizarding disasters. His first would be to report on the escape of notorious Muggle-killer ‘Serious’ Black from Azkaban (later revealed, of course, to be wrong). But years later, more reports followed: an attack at a ‘Kwidditch’ tournament, an import of three foreign dragons and a sphinx, a mass breakout at Azkaban, the return of an evil wizard whom he could not name for some reason. This slowly building horror culminated in a report of all-out war; of Fudge informing the Minister that ‘Death Eaters’ openly tortured Muggles, that ‘giants’ roamed through the countryside, that ‘Dementors’ now filled the land with a joy-destroying mist, that his own government had been infiltrated by mind-controlling magic. \n\nThe Prime Minister’s reaction to this news varied. At first, of course, he was confused; he barely knew anything about wizards, after all, never mind the fact that some of them posed such a threat to the nation. As he began to understand more about the wizarding world, however, this confusion soon evolved into fear, and outrage. Perhaps the best example of this was his closing conversation with Fudge, who had to grimly report the ascent of Voldemort and his followers. Confused and irritated, the Prime Minister argued that, as wizards, surely they can ‘sort out – well – anything!’\n\n\u003e Fudge, smiling, kindly replied, ‘The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.’ \n\u003cbr\u003e *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* \u003c/br\u003e"}],"shortDescription":"The Muggles who are in on the wizarding secret","source":[{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T14:09:40.836000","contentTypeId":"source","contentfulId":"2k2KO28OoqIDxDSTJZXy2W","displayTitle":"Discover the films","entryTitle":"Wizarding World Image Crediting","franchiseName":"Harry Potter","franchiseSubtitle":"to Fantastic Beasts","purchaseLink":"https://www.wizardingworld.com/discover/films","sourceType":"Film"}],"tags":[{"_updatedAt":"2019-08-01T11:51:53.952000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"3B1lhNkNAFaVH3lS0WLMxV","name":"feature"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:07:02.831000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"L1Cef6BUiA2eC84VPklgq","name":"hide-from-app"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:06:54.732000","authorComment":"This excludes the content item from its index page i.e. quizzes run to Quiz section automatically, but for other Quiz content (publishing elsewhere) it excludes from Discover.

You find the correct brick – three up, two across – and tap the wall behind the Leaky Cauldron courtyard three times. And there it is, the wizarding world opening up in front of you, revealing the cobbled street beyond. We can completely understand why Harry wishes he has ‘*about eight more eyes*’ at this moment – who wouldn’t want such excitement and exhilaration at the start of their shopping trip? So, for starters, the magical brick entrance to Diagon Alley is something we absolutely wouldn’t want to miss out on, whereas it sounds like you can walk straight into Hogsmeade just like any other Muggle town. Dull as as an old cauldron. \n\nAnd once you’re in, Diagon Alley is bustling with witches and wizards of all ages and from all walks of life. Hogsmeade, on the other hand, sounds like it only comes to life when Hogwarts students are allowed to visit. We’d want to see witches complaining about the price of dragon liver outside the apothecary, and children marvelling over broomsticks in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies. The thing about Diagon Alley is that it gives an insight into wizarding life that feels realistic, palpable, even gritty. Hogsmeade is a fairy tale village that doesn’t reflect the day to day lives of wizarding folk. Picturesque? Yes. Nice for the occasional weekend trip? Yes. Good for shopping? We’d rather have down-to-earth Diagon Alley any day of the week.  \n\nWhat comes with a shopping destination for real wizards is choice and variety. And with that variety comes competition – meaning that we think Diagon Alley houses the best wizarding products Galleons can buy. Remember that Harry has to write to Flourish and Blotts in Diagon Alley to get a copy of Advanced Potion Making and not just pop over to a bookshop in Hogsmeade. Not to mention that Hogwarts students appear to pick up their school supplies in Diagon Alley, rather than choosing other wizarding shopping destinations. It’s also in Diagon Alley where Harry first sees the Firebolt. Quality Quidditch Supplies is selling the state-of-the-art racing broom, later used by the Irish in the Quidditch World Cup. With options like these, not only would you be able to get everything you actually needed, but window-shopping would be an absolute dream. \n\nAgain and again Diagon Alley proves itself as the place to shop. It has Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions (emphasis on the all), and it is also home to Ollivanders which Hagrid says: ‘*Just Ollivanders left now – only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand*.’ And let’s not forget that it has a plethora of options when it comes to pets: Eelops Owl Emporium which gave us beautiful Hedwig, as well as the Magical Menagerie that gave us crafty Crookshanks! \n\nShops and magical products aside, Diagon Alley is superior to Hogsmeade because of the opportunities to bump into friends outside of Hogwarts! Hogsmeade might be pretty, but it’s practically next door to the castle. We love Harry, Ron and Hermione’s reunions during the summer holidays in Diagon Alley, and we’d definitely want to experience that sense of anticipation as students flocked there to buy school supplies, catch up with friends and prepare for the year ahead.\n\nSorry Hogsmeade, you just can’t compete with this bustling hub of wizarding activity!\n"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-05-18T13:31:39.318000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"3IYj8JINo4LFVJKwdN1r96","entryTitle":"WEB-2020-FEATURE-which-is-better-diagon-alley-or-hogsmeade-text-section-3","text":"## The case for Hogsmeade\n\nIn *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*, a new realm of opportunities opened up to Hogwarts students: access to the neighbouring village of Hogsmeade.

We associated Diagon Alley with getting back to school, picking up books and supplies and the like, while Hogsmeade was designed as a break from school, a chance for students to unwind and properly start feeling more independent. After all, the trip was only available to third-year Hogwarts students and beyond – getting to go to Hogsmeade was like a dream for the younger pupils.\n\nAnd while Diagon Alley appears to only have one pub (The famous Leaky Cauldron, of course) Hogsmeade has options! You can pop to the Three Broomsticks for a flagon of Butterbeer with Madam Rosmerta, or if you want a bit of quiet time, you can go to the Hog’s Head, which is admittedly a bit dodgier, but good for private meetings. While we’re aware of the legendary status of The Leaky Cauldron, Hogsmeade feels more like the place to go for a bit of an escape, and not just for students, but for Hogwarts staff too. Witnessing the likes of Professor Flitwick enjoying a flamboyant cherry drink with an umbrella in the Three Broomsticks, for example, was simply a joy to see.\n\nBeyond the more vibrant social haunts, Hogsmeade is known for confectionary shops such as Honeydukes, which has an enviable array of different sweets on offer, and the extremely popular Zonko’s Joke Shop, where students could purchase all sorts of whacky and wonderful items to infuriate Filch the caretaker with. Compared to Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade just seems a bit more fun, and dare we say it, a bit more rebellious. Just look at the Shrieking Shack, the ‘haunted’ house that couldn’t help but spark interest in its young student visitors. Hogsmeade definitely has a more unruly aura. \n\nWhile Hogwarts students were more likely go to Diagon Alley with their parents or families, Hogsmeade was altogether the cooler option to go with your friends, or even go on dates. It is altogether quirkier, more interesting and more varied than Diagon Alley, and served as an important location for many key moments in the Harry Potter series.\n\nSure, Diagon Alley may have been Harry’s first proper introduction to the wizarding world – but Hogsmeade is when things really got interesting. The wizarding village’s atmosphere was always a point of consternation for Hogwarts students, and really seemed to represent the curiosity and excitement of growing up. \n\n                                  ***\n\nSo, Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade?

Location must be revealed by the Secret Keeper orally or in writing. \n\n*Favourite moment:*\n\n\u003e ‘Harry thought, and no sooner had he reached the part about\nnumber twelve, Grimmauld Place, than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. Harry gaped at it. The stereo in number eleven thudded on. Apparently the Muggles inside hadn’t felt anything.’\n\n## The entrance to St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries\n\n*Location:*\n\nNear Purge \u0026 Dowse Ltd, an old department store in London.\n\n*How to enter:*\n\nApproach a glass window of Purge \u0026 Dowse Ltd and speak very quietly to the ugliest dummy you can see in the window display, with a green pinafore dress. The dummy will nod and beckon you through the glass. Step through the glass and into the hospital. \n\n*Favourite moment:* \n\n\u003e ‘They nodded, clustering around her. Moody gave Harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy, her breath steaming up the glass. ‘Wotcher,’ she said, ‘we’re here to see Arthur Weasley.’’\n\n\n## Ministry of Magic: visitor entrance \n\n*Location:*\n\nThe heart of London.\n\n*How to enter:*\n\nFind the old red telephone box, step inside and then dial 62442. When asked by a cool female voice to state your name and business, do so. If you are accepted as a visitor, you should put on the silver badge provided. The telephone box will then take you down into the Ministry of Magic. \n\n*Favourite moment:*\n\n\u003e ‘The further they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub and an overflowing skip. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic.’ \n\n## Entrance to the Chamber of Secrets\n\n*Location:*\n\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, girls’ bathroom, first floor.\n\n*How to enter:*\n\nLook for the tiny snake scratched on one of the copper taps. Speak Parseltongue – ‘Open up’ would do. The tap will spin and the sink will move downwards, exposing a large pipe for you to slide through.  \n\n*Favourite moment:*\n\n\u003e ‘‘Harry,’ said Ron, ‘say something. Something in Parseltongue.’\n\u003e \n\u003e ‘But –’ Harry thought hard. The only times he’d ever managed to speak Parseltongue were when he’d been faced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it was real.\n\u003e \n\u003e ‘Open up,’ he said.\n\u003e He looked at Ron, who shook his head.\n\u003e ‘English,’ he said.’’  \n\n## Entrance to the Shrieking Shack\n\n*Location:*\n\nGrounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Whomping Willow. \n\n*How to enter:*\n\nTouch a specific knot on the trunk of the Whomping Willow. This will freeze its dangerous branches and allow you to enter a passageway through a gap in the tree’s roots. The tunnel will take you to the Shrieking Shack. \n\n*Favourite moment:*\n\n\u003e ‘Crookshanks darted forwards. He slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.\nAbruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.\n\u003e\n\u003e ‘Crookshanks!’ Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry’s arm painfully hard. ‘How did he know –?’\n\u003e \n\u003e ‘He’s friends with that dog,’ said Harry grimly. ‘I’ve seen them\ntogether. Come on – and keep your wand out –’’ \n\n## The entrance to the Hogwarts kitchens\n\n*Location:*\n\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, behind a picture of a giant fruit bowl. On the same corridor as the Hufflepuff common room. \n\n*How to enter:*\n\nApproach the painting of the fruit bow. Tickle the huge green pear. It will giggle and then turn into a green door handle. Enter. \n\n*Favourite moment:*  \n\n\u003e ‘‘How do you get in there?’ Hermione said, in an innocently casual sort of voice.\n\u003e \n\u003e ‘Easy,’ said Fred, ‘concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and –’ He stopped, and looked suspiciously at her. ‘Why?’\n\u003e \n\u003e ‘Nothing,’ said Hermione quickly..’’"}],"tags":[{"_updatedAt":"2019-08-01T11:51:53.952000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"3B1lhNkNAFaVH3lS0WLMxV","name":"feature"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:07:02.831000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"L1Cef6BUiA2eC84VPklgq","name":"hide-from-app"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:06:54.732000","authorComment":"This excludes the content item from its index page i.e. quizzes run to Quiz section automatically, but for other Quiz content (publishing elsewhere) it excludes from Discover.

Since the novels were published, J.K. Rowling has also revealed that Lupin’s father’s name was ‘Lyall’ which originates from the Old Norse word ‘Liulfr’, once again meaning wolf.

These include poltergeists, Boggarts and other strange creatures that, while sometimes ghostlike in appearance and behaviour, have never been truly alive and remain something of a mystery even to the wizarding world.\n\nOn an investigative trip into a dense Welsh forest in which a particularly vicious Boggart was supposed to be lurking, Lyall ran across his future wife. Hope Howell, a beautiful Muggle girl who worked in an insurance office in Cardiff, had taken an ill-advised walk through what she believed to be innocent woodland. Boggarts and poltergeists may be sensed by Muggles, and Hope, a particularly imaginative and sensitive person, had become convinced that something was watching her from between the dark trees. Eventually, her imagination became so overactive that the Boggart assumed a form: that of a large, evil-looking man, bearing down on her with a snarl and outstretched hands in the gloom. Hearing her scream, young Lyall came sprinting through the trees, causing the apparition to shrink into a field mushroom with one wave of his wand. The terrified Hope thought, in her confusion, that he had driven her would-be attacker away, and his first words to her – ‘it’s all right, it was only a Boggart’ – made no impression on her. Noticing how very beautiful she was, Lyall made the wise decision not to talk about Boggarts any more, but instead agreed that the man had been very big and scary, and that the only sensible thing to do was for him to accompany Hope home to protect her.\n\nThe young couple fell in love, and not even Lyall’s shamefaced admission, some months later, that Hope had never really been in danger, dented her enthusiasm for him. To Lyall’s delight, Hope accepted his proposal of marriage and threw herself enthusiastically into preparations for the wedding, complete with a Boggart-topped cake.\n\nLyall and Hope’s first and only child, Remus John, was born after a year of marriage. A happy, healthy little boy, he showed early signs of magic and both parents imagined that he would follow in his father’s footsteps, attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in due course.\n\n## Bitten ###\n\nBy the time that Remus was four years old, the amount of Dark magical activity across the country was increasing steadily. While few yet knew what lay behind the mounting attacks and sightings, Lord Voldemort’s first ascent to power was in progress and Death Eaters were recruiting all kinds of Dark creatures to join them in their quest to overthrow the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry called in the services of authorities on Dark creatures – even those as minor as Boggarts and poltergeists – to help it understand and contain the threat. Lyall Lupin was among those asked to join the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, which he did gladly. It was here that Lyall came face-to-face with a werewolf called Fenrir Greyback, who had been brought in for questioning about the death of two Muggle children.\n\nThe Werewolf Registry was badly maintained. Werewolves were so shunned by wizarding society that they generally avoided contact with other people; they lived in self-described ‘packs’ and did all they could to avoid being registered. Greyback, whom the Ministry did not know to be a werewolf, claimed to be nothing more than a Muggle tramp who was utterly amazed at finding himself in a room full of wizards, and horrified by the talk about the poor, dead children.\n\nGreyback’s filthy clothing and lack of wand were sufficient to persuade two overworked and ignorant members of the questioning committee that he was telling the truth, but Lyall Lupin was not so easily fooled. He recognised certain telltale signs in Greyback’s appearance and behaviour and told the committee that Greyback ought to be kept in detention until the next full moon, a mere twenty-four hours later.\n\nGreyback sat in silence while Lyall was laughed at by his fellow committee members (‘Lyall, you just stick to Welsh Boggarts, that’s what you’re good at’). Lyall, generally a mild-mannered man, grew angry. He described werewolves as ‘soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death’. The committee ordered Lyall out of the room, the head of the committee apologised to the Muggle tramp and Greyback was released.\n\nThe wizard who escorted Greyback out of the inquiry was intending to place a Memory Charm upon him, so that he would forget having been inside the Ministry. Before he had a chance to do so, he was overpowered by Greyback and two accomplices who had been lurking at the entrance, and the three werewolves fled.\n\nGreyback lost no time in sharing with his friends how Lyall Lupin had just described them. Their revenge on the wizard who thought that werewolves deserved nothing but death would be swift and terrible.\n\nShortly before Remus Lupin’s fifth birthday, as he slept peacefully in his bed, Fenrir Greyback forced open the boy’s window and attacked him. Lyall reached the bedroom in time to save his son’s life, driving Greyback out of the house with a number of powerful curses. However, henceforth, Remus would be a fully fledged werewolf.\n\nLyall Lupin never forgave himself for the words he had spoken in front of Greyback at the inquiry: ‘soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death’. He had parroted what was the common view of werewolves in his community, but his son was what he had always been – loveable and clever – except for that terrible period at the full moon when he suffered an excruciating transformation and became a danger to everyone around him. For many years, Lyall kept the truth about the attack, including the identity of the attacker, from his son, fearing Remus’s recriminations.\n\n## Childhood ###\n\nLyall did all he could to find a cure, but neither potions nor spells could help his son. From this time onwards, the family’s lives were dominated by the need to hide Remus’s condition. They uprooted themselves from village to town, leaving the instant that rumours of the boy’s odd behaviour started. Fellow witches and wizards noticed how peaky Remus became as new moon approached, not to mention his monthly disappearances. Remus was not allowed to play with other children, in case he let slip the truth of his condition. In consequence, and in spite of his loving parents, he was a very lonely boy.\n\nWhile Remus was small, his containment during his transformation was not difficult; a locked room and plenty of silencing spells usually sufficed. However, as he grew, so did his wolfish self, and by the time he was ten years old, he was capable of pounding down doors and smashing windows. Ever more powerful spells were needed to contain him and both Hope and Lyall grew thin with worry and fear. They adored their son, but they knew that their community – already beset with fears at the mounting Dark activity around them – would not be lenient on an uncontrolled werewolf. The hopes that they had once had for their son seemed in ruins, and Lyall educated Remus at home, certain that he would never be able to set foot in school.\n\nShortly before Remus’s eleventh birthday, no less a person than Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, arrived uninvited on the Lupins’ doorstep. Flustered and frightened, Lyall and Hope tried to block his entrance, but somehow, five minutes later, Dumbledore was sitting at the fireside, eating crumpets and playing Gobstones with Remus.\n\nDumbledore explained to the Lupins that he knew what had happened to their son. Greyback had boasted of what he had done and Dumbledore had spies among Dark creatures. However, Dumbledore told the Lupins that he saw no reason why Remus should not come to school, and described the arrangements that he had made to give the boy a safe and secure place for his transformations. Due to the widespread prejudice around werewolves, Dumbledore agreed that for Remus’s own sake his condition should not be broadcast. Once a month, he would leave for a secure and comfortable house in the village of Hogsmeade, guarded by many spells and reached only by an underground passage from the Hogwarts grounds, where he could transform in peace.\n\nRemus’s excitement was beyond anything he had known before. It was the dream of his life to meet other children and have, for the first time, friends and playmates.\n\n## School ###\n\nSorted into Gryffindor house, Remus Lupin was swiftly befriended by two cheerful, confident and rebellious boys, James Potter and Sirius Black. They were attracted by Remus’s quiet sense of humour and a kindness that they valued, even if they did not always possess it themselves. Remus, always the underdog’s friend, was kind to short and rather slow Peter Pettigrew, a fellow Gryffindor, whom James and Sirius might not have thought worthy of their attention without Remus’s persuasion. Soon, these four became inseparable.\n\nRemus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. He did not approve of their relentless bullying of Severus Snape, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.\n\nInevitably, his three best friends soon became curious as to why Remus had to vanish once a month. Convinced by his lonely childhood that his friends would desert him if they knew that he was a werewolf, Remus made up ever more elaborate lies to account for his absences. James and Sirius guessed the truth in their second year. To Remus’s astonished gratitude, they not only remained his friends but thought up an ingenious method of easing his monthly isolation. They also gave him a nickname that would follow him all through school: ‘Moony’. Remus finished his school career as a Prefect.\n\n## The Order of the Phoenix ###\n\nBy the time the four friends left school, Lord Voldemort’s ascendancy was almost complete. True resistance to him was concentrated in the underground organisation called the Order of the Phoenix, which all four young men joined.\n\nThe death of James Potter, along with his wife Lily, at the hands of Lord Voldemort, was one of the most traumatic events of Remus’s already troubled life. His friends meant even more to him than to other people, because he had long since accepted the fact that most people would treat him as untouchable, and that there could be no possibility of marrying and having children. Even worse, within twenty-four hours he had also lost his two other best friends. Remus was in the north of the country on Order of the Phoenix business when he heard the horrible news that one of them had murdered the other, and was now in Azkaban, a traitor to the Order and to Lily and James themselves.\n\nThe downfall of Voldemort, such a source of jubilation to the rest of the wizarding community, marked the beginning of a long stretch of loneliness and unhappiness for Remus. He had lost his three close friends and, with the Order disbanded, his previous comrades returned to busy lives with families. His mother was now dead, and while Lyall, his father, was always delighted to see his son, Remus refused to endanger his father’s peaceful existence by returning to live with him.\n\nRemus now lived a hand-to-mouth existence, taking jobs that were far below his level of ability, always knowing that he would have to leave them before his pattern of growing sick once a month at the full moon was noticed by his workmates.\n\n## The Wolfsbane Potion ###\n\nOne development in the wizarding community gave Remus hope: the discovery of the Wolfsbane Potion. While this did not prevent a werewolf losing his human form once a month, it restricted his transformation to that of an ordinary and sleepy wolf. It had always been Remus’s worst fear that he would kill while out of his right mind. However, the Wolfsbane Potion was complex and the ingredients very expensive. Remus had no chance to sample it without admitting what he was and so he continued his lonely, itinerant existence.\n\n## Return to Hogwarts ###\n\nOnce again, Albus Dumbledore changed the course of Remus Lupin’s life when he tracked him down to a tumbledown, semi-derelict cottage in Yorkshire. Delighted to see the Headmaster, Remus was amazed when Dumbledore offered him the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He was only persuaded to accept when Dumbledore explained that there would be a limitless supply of Wolfsbane Potion, courtesy of the Potions master, Severus Snape.\n\nAt Hogwarts, Remus revealed himself to be a gifted teacher, with a rare flair for his own subject and a profound understanding of his pupils. He was, as ever, particularly drawn to the underdog, and both Neville Longbottom and Harry Potter benefited from his wisdom and kindness.\n\nHowever, Remus’s old flaw was at work. He had grave suspicions about one of his old friends, a known fugitive, but did not share them with anyone at Hogwarts. His desperate desire to belong and to be liked meant that he was neither as brave nor as honest as he ought to have been.\n\nAn unfortunate combination of circumstances arose that resulted in Remus undergoing a true werewolf’s transformation in the grounds of the school. Severus Snape’s resentment, never abated by Remus’s subsequent respectful politeness, made sure that it was widely known what the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher was. Remus felt obliged to resign and departed Hogwarts once more.\n\n## Marriage ###\n\nAs Lord Voldemort once again gained ascendancy, the old resistance regrouped and Remus found himself once more part of the Order of the Phoenix.\n\nThis time, the group included an Auror who had been too young to belong to the Order during its first incarnation. Clever, brave and funny, pink-haired Nymphadora Tonks was a protégée of Alastor ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody, the toughest and most grizzled Auror of them all.\n\nRemus, so often melancholy and lonely, was first amused, then impressed, then seriously smitten by the young witch. He had never fallen in love before. If it had happened in peacetime, Remus would have simply taken himself off to a new place and a new job, so that he did not have to endure the pain of watching Tonks fall in love with a handsome, young wizard in the Auror office, which was what he expected to happen. However, this was war; they were both needed in the Order of the Phoenix, and nobody knew what the next day would bring. Remus felt justified in remaining exactly where he was, keeping his feelings to himself but secretly rejoicing every time somebody paired him with Tonks on some overnight mission.\n\nIt had never occurred to Remus that Tonks could return his feelings because he had become so used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. One night when they lay in hiding outside a known Death Eater’s house, after a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (‘He’s still handsome, isn’t he, even after Azkaban?’). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend (‘He always got the women.’). At this, Tonks became suddenly angry. ‘You’d know perfectly well who I’ve fallen for, if you weren’t too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.’\n\nRemus’s immediate response was a happiness he had never experienced in his life, but this was extinguished almost at once by a sense of crushing duty. He had always known that he could not marry and run the risk of passing on his painful, shameful condition. He therefore pretended not to understand Tonks, which did not fool her at all. Wiser than Remus, she was sure that he loved her, but that he was refusing to admit it out of mistaken nobility. However, he avoided any further excursions with her, barely talked to her, and started volunteering for the most dangerous missions. Tonks became desperately unhappy, convinced not only that the man she loved would never willingly spend time with her again, but also that he might walk to his death rather than admit his feelings.\n\nRemus and Tonks both fought Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries, a battle that resulted in the public exposure of Voldemort’s return. The loss of the last of his school friends during this battle did nothing to soften Remus’s increasingly self-destructive attitude. Tonks could only watch in despair as he volunteered to spy for the Order, leaving to live among fellow werewolves to try to persuade them to Dumbledore’s side. In doing this, he was exposing himself to the possible reprisals of the werewolf who had changed his life forever, Fenrir Greyback.\n\nRemus came face-to-face with both Greyback and Tonks at Hogwarts barely a year later, when the Order clashed with Death Eaters within the castle. During this battle, Remus lost yet another person he had loved: Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore had been adored by every member of the Order of the Phoenix, but to Remus, he had represented the sort of kindness, tolerance and understanding that he had received from nobody in the world outside his parents and his three best friends, and had been the only man ever to offer him a position within normal wizarding society.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bloody fight, inspired by Fleur Delacour’s protestation of enduring love for Bill Weasley, who had been savaged by Greyback, Tonks made a brave, public declaration of her feelings for Remus, who was forced to admit the strength of his love for her. In spite of continuing misgivings that he was acting selfishly, Remus married Tonks quietly in the north of Scotland, with witnesses taken from the local wizarding tavern. He continued to fear that the stigma attached to him would infect his wife and wished for no fanfare around their union; he swung constantly between elation that he was married to the woman of his dreams and terror of what he might have brought upon them both.\n\n## Parenthood ###\n\nWithin a few weeks of their marriage, Remus realised that Tonks was pregnant and every fear he had ever had surfaced. He was convinced that he had passed on his condition to an innocent child and that he had condemned Tonks to the same life as his mother, forever moving around, unable to settle, having to hide her increasingly violent child from sight. Full of remorse and self-recrimination, Remus fled, leaving the pregnant Tonks, seeking out Harry and offering to accompany him on whatever death-defying adventure awaited.\n\nTo Remus’s shock and displeasure, the seventeen-year-old Harry not only declined his offer but became angry and insulting. He told his ex-teacher that he was acting selfishly and irresponsibly. Remus responded with uncharacteristic violence and stormed out of the house, taking refuge in a corner of the Leaky Cauldron, where he sat drinking and fuming.\n\nHowever, after a few hours’ reflection, Remus was forced to accept that his ex-pupil had just taught him a valuable lesson. James and Lily, Remus reflected, had stuck with Harry even unto their own deaths. His own parents, Lyall and Hope, had sacrificed their peace and security to keep the family together. Bitterly ashamed, Remus left the inn and returned to his wife, where he begged her forgiveness and assured her that, come what may, he would never leave her again. For the rest of Tonks’s pregnancy, Remus eschewed missions for the Order of the Phoenix and made it his first priority to protect his wife and unborn child.\n\nThe Lupins’ son, Edward Remus (‘Teddy’), was named for Remus’s recently deceased father-in-law. To both parents’ relief and delight, he showed no sign of lycanthropy when born, but inherited his mother’s ability to change his appearance at will. On the night of Teddy’s birth, Remus briefly left Tonks and his son in the charge of his mother-in-law, so that he could go and find Harry for the first time since their angry confrontation. Here, he asked Harry to be Teddy’s godfather, feeling nothing but forgiveness and gratitude towards the person who had sent him home to the family that gave him his greatest happiness.\n\n## Death ###\n\nBoth Remus and Tonks returned to Hogwarts for the final battle against Voldemort, leaving their tiny son in the care of his grandmother. The couple knew that if Voldemort won this battle, their family was sure to be eliminated: both were notorious members of the Order of the Phoenix, Tonks was a marked woman in the eyes of her Death Eater aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange, and their son was the very antithesis of a pure-blood, having many Muggle relatives and a dash of werewolf.\n\nHaving survived numerous encounters with Death Eaters and fought his way skillfully and bravely out of many tight corners, Remus Lupin met his end at the hands of Antonin Dolohov, one of the longest-serving, most devoted and sadistic of all Voldemort’s Death Eaters. Remus was no longer in prime fighting condition when he rushed to join the fight. Months of inactivity, using mostly spells of concealment and protection, had blunted his duelling capabilities, and when he ran up against a dueller of Dolohov’s skill, now battle-hardened after months of killing and maiming, his reactions were too slow.\n\nRemus Lupin was posthumously awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class, the first werewolf ever to be accorded this honour. The example of his life and death did much to lift the stigma on werewolves. He was never forgotten by anyone who knew him: a brave, kind man who did the best he could in very difficult circumstances and who helped many more than he ever realised.\n\n## J.K. Rowling’s thoughts ###\n\nRemus Lupin was one of my favourite characters in the entire Potter series. I made myself cry all over again while writing this entry, because I hated killing him. \n\nLupin’s condition of lycanthropy (being a werewolf) was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS. All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes.\n\nRemus’s Patronus is never revealed in the Potter books, even though it is he who teaches Harry the difficult and unusual art of producing one. It is, in fact, a wolf – an ordinary wolf, not a werewolf. Wolves are family-orientated and non-aggressive, but Remus dislikes the form of his Patronus, which is a constant reminder of his affliction. Everything wolfish disgusts him, and he often produces a non-corporeal Patronus deliberately, especially when others are watching."}],"tags":[{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-25T10:01:10.297000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"cThvegmq65mxJoDeI09Cr","displayName":"J.K.

These include poltergeists, Boggarts and other strange creatures that, while sometimes ghostlike in appearance and behaviour, have never been truly alive and remain something of a mystery even to the wizarding world.\n\nOn an investigative trip into a dense Welsh forest in which a particularly vicious Boggart was supposed to be lurking, Lyall ran across his future wife. Hope Howell, a beautiful Muggle girl who worked in an insurance office in Cardiff, had taken an ill-advised walk through what she believed to be innocent woodland. Boggarts and poltergeists may be sensed by Muggles, and Hope, a particularly imaginative and sensitive person, had become convinced that something was watching her from between the dark trees. Eventually, her imagination became so overactive that the Boggart assumed a form: that of a large, evil-looking man, bearing down on her with a snarl and outstretched hands in the gloom. Hearing her scream, young Lyall came sprinting through the trees, causing the apparition to shrink into a field mushroom with one wave of his wand. The terrified Hope thought, in her confusion, that he had driven her would-be attacker away, and his first words to her – ‘it’s all right, it was only a Boggart’ – made no impression on her. Noticing how very beautiful she was, Lyall made the wise decision not to talk about Boggarts any more, but instead agreed that the man had been very big and scary, and that the only sensible thing to do was for him to accompany Hope home to protect her.\n\nThe young couple fell in love, and not even Lyall’s shamefaced admission, some months later, that Hope had never really been in danger, dented her enthusiasm for him. To Lyall’s delight, Hope accepted his proposal of marriage and threw herself enthusiastically into preparations for the wedding, complete with a Boggart-topped cake.\n\nLyall and Hope’s first and only child, Remus John, was born after a year of marriage. A happy, healthy little boy, he showed early signs of magic and both parents imagined that he would follow in his father’s footsteps, attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in due course.\n\n## Bitten ###\n\nBy the time that Remus was four years old, the amount of Dark magical activity across the country was increasing steadily. While few yet knew what lay behind the mounting attacks and sightings, Lord Voldemort’s first ascent to power was in progress and Death Eaters were recruiting all kinds of Dark creatures to join them in their quest to overthrow the Ministry of Magic. The Ministry called in the services of authorities on Dark creatures – even those as minor as Boggarts and poltergeists – to help it understand and contain the threat. Lyall Lupin was among those asked to join the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, which he did gladly. It was here that Lyall came face-to-face with a werewolf called Fenrir Greyback, who had been brought in for questioning about the death of two Muggle children.\n\nThe Werewolf Registry was badly maintained. Werewolves were so shunned by wizarding society that they generally avoided contact with other people; they lived in self-described ‘packs’ and did all they could to avoid being registered. Greyback, whom the Ministry did not know to be a werewolf, claimed to be nothing more than a Muggle tramp who was utterly amazed at finding himself in a room full of wizards, and horrified by the talk about the poor, dead children.\n\nGreyback’s filthy clothing and lack of wand were sufficient to persuade two overworked and ignorant members of the questioning committee that he was telling the truth, but Lyall Lupin was not so easily fooled. He recognised certain telltale signs in Greyback’s appearance and behaviour and told the committee that Greyback ought to be kept in detention until the next full moon, a mere twenty-four hours later.\n\nGreyback sat in silence while Lyall was laughed at by his fellow committee members (‘Lyall, you just stick to Welsh Boggarts, that’s what you’re good at’). Lyall, generally a mild-mannered man, grew angry. He described werewolves as ‘soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death’. The committee ordered Lyall out of the room, the head of the committee apologised to the Muggle tramp and Greyback was released.\n\nThe wizard who escorted Greyback out of the inquiry was intending to place a Memory Charm upon him, so that he would forget having been inside the Ministry. Before he had a chance to do so, he was overpowered by Greyback and two accomplices who had been lurking at the entrance, and the three werewolves fled.\n\nGreyback lost no time in sharing with his friends how Lyall Lupin had just described them. Their revenge on the wizard who thought that werewolves deserved nothing but death would be swift and terrible.\n\nShortly before Remus Lupin’s fifth birthday, as he slept peacefully in his bed, Fenrir Greyback forced open the boy’s window and attacked him. Lyall reached the bedroom in time to save his son’s life, driving Greyback out of the house with a number of powerful curses. However, henceforth, Remus would be a fully fledged werewolf.\n\nLyall Lupin never forgave himself for the words he had spoken in front of Greyback at the inquiry: ‘soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death’. He had parroted what was the common view of werewolves in his community, but his son was what he had always been – loveable and clever – except for that terrible period at the full moon when he suffered an excruciating transformation and became a danger to everyone around him. For many years, Lyall kept the truth about the attack, including the identity of the attacker, from his son, fearing Remus’s recriminations.\n\n## Childhood ###\n\nLyall did all he could to find a cure, but neither potions nor spells could help his son. From this time onwards, the family’s lives were dominated by the need to hide Remus’s condition. They uprooted themselves from village to town, leaving the instant that rumours of the boy’s odd behaviour started. Fellow witches and wizards noticed how peaky Remus became as new moon approached, not to mention his monthly disappearances. Remus was not allowed to play with other children, in case he let slip the truth of his condition. In consequence, and in spite of his loving parents, he was a very lonely boy.\n\nWhile Remus was small, his containment during his transformation was not difficult; a locked room and plenty of silencing spells usually sufficed. However, as he grew, so did his wolfish self, and by the time he was ten years old, he was capable of pounding down doors and smashing windows. Ever more powerful spells were needed to contain him and both Hope and Lyall grew thin with worry and fear. They adored their son, but they knew that their community – already beset with fears at the mounting Dark activity around them – would not be lenient on an uncontrolled werewolf. The hopes that they had once had for their son seemed in ruins, and Lyall educated Remus at home, certain that he would never be able to set foot in school.\n\nShortly before Remus’s eleventh birthday, no less a person than Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, arrived uninvited on the Lupins’ doorstep. Flustered and frightened, Lyall and Hope tried to block his entrance, but somehow, five minutes later, Dumbledore was sitting at the fireside, eating crumpets and playing Gobstones with Remus.\n\nDumbledore explained to the Lupins that he knew what had happened to their son. Greyback had boasted of what he had done and Dumbledore had spies among Dark creatures. However, Dumbledore told the Lupins that he saw no reason why Remus should not come to school, and described the arrangements that he had made to give the boy a safe and secure place for his transformations. Due to the widespread prejudice around werewolves, Dumbledore agreed that for Remus’s own sake his condition should not be broadcast. Once a month, he would leave for a secure and comfortable house in the village of Hogsmeade, guarded by many spells and reached only by an underground passage from the Hogwarts grounds, where he could transform in peace.\n\nRemus’s excitement was beyond anything he had known before. It was the dream of his life to meet other children and have, for the first time, friends and playmates.\n\n## School ###\n\nSorted into Gryffindor house, Remus Lupin was swiftly befriended by two cheerful, confident and rebellious boys, James Potter and Sirius Black. They were attracted by Remus’s quiet sense of humour and a kindness that they valued, even if they did not always possess it themselves. Remus, always the underdog’s friend, was kind to short and rather slow Peter Pettigrew, a fellow Gryffindor, whom James and Sirius might not have thought worthy of their attention without Remus’s persuasion. Soon, these four became inseparable.\n\nRemus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. He did not approve of their relentless bullying of Severus Snape, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.\n\nInevitably, his three best friends soon became curious as to why Remus had to vanish once a month. Convinced by his lonely childhood that his friends would desert him if they knew that he was a werewolf, Remus made up ever more elaborate lies to account for his absences. James and Sirius guessed the truth in their second year. To Remus’s astonished gratitude, they not only remained his friends but thought up an ingenious method of easing his monthly isolation. They also gave him a nickname that would follow him all through school: ‘Moony’. Remus finished his school career as a Prefect.\n\n## The Order of the Phoenix ###\n\nBy the time the four friends left school, Lord Voldemort’s ascendancy was almost complete. True resistance to him was concentrated in the underground organisation called the Order of the Phoenix, which all four young men joined.\n\nThe death of James Potter, along with his wife Lily, at the hands of Lord Voldemort, was one of the most traumatic events of Remus’s already troubled life. His friends meant even more to him than to other people, because he had long since accepted the fact that most people would treat him as untouchable, and that there could be no possibility of marrying and having children. Even worse, within twenty-four hours he had also lost his two other best friends. Remus was in the north of the country on Order of the Phoenix business when he heard the horrible news that one of them had murdered the other, and was now in Azkaban, a traitor to the Order and to Lily and James themselves.\n\nThe downfall of Voldemort, such a source of jubilation to the rest of the wizarding community, marked the beginning of a long stretch of loneliness and unhappiness for Remus. He had lost his three close friends and, with the Order disbanded, his previous comrades returned to busy lives with families. His mother was now dead, and while Lyall, his father, was always delighted to see his son, Remus refused to endanger his father’s peaceful existence by returning to live with him.\n\nRemus now lived a hand-to-mouth existence, taking jobs that were far below his level of ability, always knowing that he would have to leave them before his pattern of growing sick once a month at the full moon was noticed by his workmates.\n\n## The Wolfsbane Potion ###\n\nOne development in the wizarding community gave Remus hope: the discovery of the Wolfsbane Potion. While this did not prevent a werewolf losing his human form once a month, it restricted his transformation to that of an ordinary and sleepy wolf. It had always been Remus’s worst fear that he would kill while out of his right mind. However, the Wolfsbane Potion was complex and the ingredients very expensive. Remus had no chance to sample it without admitting what he was and so he continued his lonely, itinerant existence.\n\n## Return to Hogwarts ###\n\nOnce again, Albus Dumbledore changed the course of Remus Lupin’s life when he tracked him down to a tumbledown, semi-derelict cottage in Yorkshire. Delighted to see the Headmaster, Remus was amazed when Dumbledore offered him the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He was only persuaded to accept when Dumbledore explained that there would be a limitless supply of Wolfsbane Potion, courtesy of the Potions master, Severus Snape.\n\nAt Hogwarts, Remus revealed himself to be a gifted teacher, with a rare flair for his own subject and a profound understanding of his pupils. He was, as ever, particularly drawn to the underdog, and both Neville Longbottom and Harry Potter benefited from his wisdom and kindness.\n\nHowever, Remus’s old flaw was at work. He had grave suspicions about one of his old friends, a known fugitive, but did not share them with anyone at Hogwarts. His desperate desire to belong and to be liked meant that he was neither as brave nor as honest as he ought to have been.\n\nAn unfortunate combination of circumstances arose that resulted in Remus undergoing a true werewolf’s transformation in the grounds of the school. Severus Snape’s resentment, never abated by Remus’s subsequent respectful politeness, made sure that it was widely known what the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher was. Remus felt obliged to resign and departed Hogwarts once more.\n\n## Marriage ###\n\nAs Lord Voldemort once again gained ascendancy, the old resistance regrouped and Remus found himself once more part of the Order of the Phoenix.\n\nThis time, the group included an Auror who had been too young to belong to the Order during its first incarnation. Clever, brave and funny, pink-haired Nymphadora Tonks was a protégée of Alastor ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody, the toughest and most grizzled Auror of them all.\n\nRemus, so often melancholy and lonely, was first amused, then impressed, then seriously smitten by the young witch. He had never fallen in love before. If it had happened in peacetime, Remus would have simply taken himself off to a new place and a new job, so that he did not have to endure the pain of watching Tonks fall in love with a handsome, young wizard in the Auror office, which was what he expected to happen. However, this was war; they were both needed in the Order of the Phoenix, and nobody knew what the next day would bring. Remus felt justified in remaining exactly where he was, keeping his feelings to himself but secretly rejoicing every time somebody paired him with Tonks on some overnight mission.\n\nIt had never occurred to Remus that Tonks could return his feelings because he had become so used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. One night when they lay in hiding outside a known Death Eater’s house, after a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (‘He’s still handsome, isn’t he, even after Azkaban?’). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend (‘He always got the women.’). At this, Tonks became suddenly angry. ‘You’d know perfectly well who I’ve fallen for, if you weren’t too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.’\n\nRemus’s immediate response was a happiness he had never experienced in his life, but this was extinguished almost at once by a sense of crushing duty. He had always known that he could not marry and run the risk of passing on his painful, shameful condition. He therefore pretended not to understand Tonks, which did not fool her at all. Wiser than Remus, she was sure that he loved her, but that he was refusing to admit it out of mistaken nobility. However, he avoided any further excursions with her, barely talked to her, and started volunteering for the most dangerous missions. Tonks became desperately unhappy, convinced not only that the man she loved would never willingly spend time with her again, but also that he might walk to his death rather than admit his feelings.\n\nRemus and Tonks both fought Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters in the Department of Mysteries, a battle that resulted in the public exposure of Voldemort’s return. The loss of the last of his school friends during this battle did nothing to soften Remus’s increasingly self-destructive attitude. Tonks could only watch in despair as he volunteered to spy for the Order, leaving to live among fellow werewolves to try to persuade them to Dumbledore’s side. In doing this, he was exposing himself to the possible reprisals of the werewolf who had changed his life forever, Fenrir Greyback.\n\nRemus came face-to-face with both Greyback and Tonks at Hogwarts barely a year later, when the Order clashed with Death Eaters within the castle. During this battle, Remus lost yet another person he had loved: Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore had been adored by every member of the Order of the Phoenix, but to Remus, he had represented the sort of kindness, tolerance and understanding that he had received from nobody in the world outside his parents and his three best friends, and had been the only man ever to offer him a position within normal wizarding society.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bloody fight, inspired by Fleur Delacour’s protestation of enduring love for Bill Weasley, who had been savaged by Greyback, Tonks made a brave, public declaration of her feelings for Remus, who was forced to admit the strength of his love for her. In spite of continuing misgivings that he was acting selfishly, Remus married Tonks quietly in the north of Scotland, with witnesses taken from the local wizarding tavern. He continued to fear that the stigma attached to him would infect his wife and wished for no fanfare around their union; he swung constantly between elation that he was married to the woman of his dreams and terror of what he might have brought upon them both.\n\n## Parenthood ###\n\nWithin a few weeks of their marriage, Remus realised that Tonks was pregnant and every fear he had ever had surfaced. He was convinced that he had passed on his condition to an innocent child and that he had condemned Tonks to the same life as his mother, forever moving around, unable to settle, having to hide her increasingly violent child from sight. Full of remorse and self-recrimination, Remus fled, leaving the pregnant Tonks, seeking out Harry and offering to accompany him on whatever death-defying adventure awaited.\n\nTo Remus’s shock and displeasure, the seventeen-year-old Harry not only declined his offer but became angry and insulting. He told his ex-teacher that he was acting selfishly and irresponsibly. Remus responded with uncharacteristic violence and stormed out of the house, taking refuge in a corner of the Leaky Cauldron, where he sat drinking and fuming.\n\nHowever, after a few hours’ reflection, Remus was forced to accept that his ex-pupil had just taught him a valuable lesson. James and Lily, Remus reflected, had stuck with Harry even unto their own deaths. His own parents, Lyall and Hope, had sacrificed their peace and security to keep the family together. Bitterly ashamed, Remus left the inn and returned to his wife, where he begged her forgiveness and assured her that, come what may, he would never leave her again. For the rest of Tonks’s pregnancy, Remus eschewed missions for the Order of the Phoenix and made it his first priority to protect his wife and unborn child.\n\nThe Lupins’ son, Edward Remus (‘Teddy’), was named for Remus’s recently deceased father-in-law. To both parents’ relief and delight, he showed no sign of lycanthropy when born, but inherited his mother’s ability to change his appearance at will. On the night of Teddy’s birth, Remus briefly left Tonks and his son in the charge of his mother-in-law, so that he could go and find Harry for the first time since their angry confrontation. Here, he asked Harry to be Teddy’s godfather, feeling nothing but forgiveness and gratitude towards the person who had sent him home to the family that gave him his greatest happiness.\n\n## Death ###\n\nBoth Remus and Tonks returned to Hogwarts for the final battle against Voldemort, leaving their tiny son in the care of his grandmother. The couple knew that if Voldemort won this battle, their family was sure to be eliminated: both were notorious members of the Order of the Phoenix, Tonks was a marked woman in the eyes of her Death Eater aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange, and their son was the very antithesis of a pure-blood, having many Muggle relatives and a dash of werewolf.\n\nHaving survived numerous encounters with Death Eaters and fought his way skillfully and bravely out of many tight corners, Remus Lupin met his end at the hands of Antonin Dolohov, one of the longest-serving, most devoted and sadistic of all Voldemort’s Death Eaters. Remus was no longer in prime fighting condition when he rushed to join the fight. Months of inactivity, using mostly spells of concealment and protection, had blunted his duelling capabilities, and when he ran up against a dueller of Dolohov’s skill, now battle-hardened after months of killing and maiming, his reactions were too slow.\n\nRemus Lupin was posthumously awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class, the first werewolf ever to be accorded this honour. The example of his life and death did much to lift the stigma on werewolves. He was never forgotten by anyone who knew him: a brave, kind man who did the best he could in very difficult circumstances and who helped many more than he ever realised.\n\n## J.K. Rowling’s thoughts ###\n\nRemus Lupin was one of my favourite characters in the entire Potter series. I made myself cry all over again while writing this entry, because I hated killing him. \n\nLupin’s condition of lycanthropy (being a werewolf) was a metaphor for those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS. All kinds of superstitions seem to surround blood-borne conditions, probably due to taboos surrounding blood itself. The wizarding community is as prone to hysteria and prejudice as the Muggle one, and the character of Lupin gave me a chance to examine those attitudes.\n\nRemus’s Patronus is never revealed in the Potter books, even though it is he who teaches Harry the difficult and unusual art of producing one. It is, in fact, a wolf – an ordinary wolf, not a werewolf.

In the story, ‘Remus’ was raised by wolves along with his brother, Romulus. If the brother’s name also sounds familiar, it’s because that’s the name Lupin went by while speaking anonymously on *Potterwatch* in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.* Clever, clever.\n\nThis isn’t the only hint of Remus’s lycanthropic tendencies, as his surname, ‘Lupin’, comes from the Latin word ‘lupus’, meaning wolf. Since the novels were published, J.K. Rowling has also revealed that Lupin’s father’s name was ‘Lyall’ which originates from the Old Norse word ‘Liulfr’, once again meaning wolf.

Not only does he calmly deal with the dreaded Dementors, he gives a traumatised Harry some chocolate because of its healing powers. To quote Madame Pomfrey, “We’ve finally got a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies.” Mind you, if we’d been given a Chocolate Frog every time we had a headache at school, instead of a cold compress, we would have never had left the nurse’s room!\n\n![lupin-train-2.0](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/5SKLxPyOHnSpJg0qtF7amp/4b031565b51cfd84ba86c49425b58684/lupin_train_2.0.png)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 2) When he stuck up for Neville in front of Snape\n\nIt’s very rare to see people being nice to Neville because so often he’s the butt of everyone’s jokes or being horrendously tortured by Snape, so we all cheered when Lupin not only defended Neville but praised him after Snape’s casual bullying comments about Neville’s capabilities. There is a great parallel between laughter defeating both Boggarts and bullies - the rebel in Lupin encourages his class to laugh at Boggart Snape, trussed up and stuffed into Mrs Longbottom’s stuffed vulture outfit, taking the sting out of his tail in Neville’s eyes, for a little while at least.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 3) When he gave all of us our first, decent, practical DADA lesson!\n\nAfter Quirrell and Lockhart, it is such a relief to have a teacher who actually knows how to repel dark, magical creatures, and we finally get to meet some of them - the first lesson with the Boggart is so exciting because we get a little peek at everyone’s deepest fears (and mummies, banshees and severed hands are all pretty terrifying), while learning how to combat those fears. No wonder Lupin’s lessons soon become the most popular in the school. All together now...Riddikulus!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 4) When he taught Harry how to repel Dementors\n\nHaving extra lessons is never much fun but learning something that is literally life-saving definitely beats having to figure out quadratic equations after school. Not only does Lupin make it explicitly clear that Harry’s stomach-churning experience with Dementors is not a weakness when Harry pops in for a cuppa, but his patience during Patronus practice really does save Harry’s life when he sees himself almost succumbing to the Dementor’s kiss across the lake. These extra-curricular classes also lay the groundwork for Harry’s future as the leader of Dumbledore’s Army. Lupin must have been incredibly proud of his former pupil when he heard the news that Harry was following in his footsteps with the DA.\n\n![harry-dementors-lupin-office](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/6qmPS48v32aKtwCY6K7nUl/d463025b4e6da61d09672648a7b1c80c/harry_wand.png)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 5) When he told Harry he was disappointed in him after the Marauder's Map incident\n\nLupin’s admonishments to Harry are equally as important as his praise. Harry has such a deep respect for his teacher so the moment when Lupin makes Harry squirm by questioning his eagerness to gamble away his parents’ sacrifice has a far greater impact than any telling off by Snape. Poor Harry - disappointing Lupin would be the worst feeling in the world. Even when Sirius and Lupin are reminiscing about James with Harry’s head in the fire, Sirius clearly remembers Lupin’s ability to make him feel ashamed of himself at school. His good opinion clearly carries a lot of weight.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 6) When he made an exam into an engaging obstacle course\n\nOne of Lupin’s greatest achievements at Hogwarts was making the dreaded end-of-year exam into a fun and thrilling obstacle course, involving battling Grindylows, Hinkypunks and Boggarts, all of which come in very useful for Harry during his next year at Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament. The care and effort that Lupin puts into inspiring his pupils at a time that would normally be horribly stressful is worth celebrating as is the fact that it also marks the very memorable occasion when Harry beat Hermione in a test.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 7) When he and Sirius gave Harry books on how to teach practical defensive magic\n\nThis is possibly the only time when Harry is excited to receive books that aren’t about Quidditch. It’s an incredibly useful and thoughtful present from two of the most important men in Harry’s life - not only are the books invaluable to Harry’s teaching DADA but the fact that it’s a present from his own, (favourite) teacher emphasises that Lupin fully supports him in his rebellion against Umbridge and this encouragement spurs Harry on in terms of confidence and teaching ability. When Harry muses about getting a Boggart for the DA to try out their Patronuses, he’s basically just channeling Lupin’s enthusiasm for lesson planning.\n\n![lupin-office-2.0](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/4HZ1HGIAwM8tFyeF5hr64k/d71da637ebc18a550b8a5ea67f533269/lupin_2.0.png)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 8) When he wisely cautioned Harry not to be blinded by his hatred of Snape\n\nIf there is a better lesson from a teacher, you’d be hard pushed to find it! Lupin being so magnanimous about Snape, even professing admiration and gratitude for his Wolfsbane potion is essentially a forerunner to Harry not only forgiving Snape but naming his son after his former enemy. One of Lupin’s strengths is the way he is able to see beyond ideas of good and bad, empathising with others, even trying to understand the actions of the werewolf who bit him. He teaches Harry to always look for the good in people, no matter how hard it is to find.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 9) When he *almost* apologised to Harry on Potterwatch\n\nIt takes a big man and an even bigger teacher to admit to their mistakes, especially so publicly. Considering that the search for Horcruxes is THE most dangerous, frightening and isolating thing that Harry, Hermione and Ron undertake, the praise that Lupin - sorry, Romulus - gives Harry over the magical airwaves is a huge turning point. One of the worst moments in The Deathly Hallows (and there are many to choose from) is the argument that breaks out between Harry and Lupin over the unborn Teddy which threatens one of Harry’s last remaining ties to his father. This reconciliation is the boost we all needed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 10) When he asked Harry to be Teddy’s godfather\n\nThis tear-jerking moment is such a beautiful, concise way of solidifying all the years of mentoring and friendship between Lupin and Harry. It means so much to Harry (and all of us), because the role of godfather is a big deal. Harry’s own godfather, Sirius, was the closest thing he had to a father because of James’ tragic death. Although they don’t know it, Lupin is carving out a similar father-figure role for Harry, as he will die only a few months later, which makes this exhilarating exchange as bittersweet as they come. The trust and respect that Lupin shows towards his favourite pupil is huge and proves once again that he is one of the best teachers to ever pass through Hogwarts.\n\n![tonks-lupin-2.0](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/6koqJNcj9ywAhiVcLdyUVk/b5392c05c8edafb175ed767f6d001bc3/lupin_tonks_2.0.png)"}],"tags":[{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:07:02.831000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"L1Cef6BUiA2eC84VPklgq","name":"hide-from-app"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-08-01T11:51:53.952000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"3B1lhNkNAFaVH3lS0WLMxV","name":"feature"}],"teaserImage":{"_updatedAt":"2020-08-04T09:51:05.179000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"2nq3BdnSQ9rpBH8KCa5pNE","entryTitle":"WB-HP3-prisoner-of-azkaban-lupin-and-harry-bridge","image":{"_updatedAt":"2020-08-04T09:51:00.435000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"6YCj4uxMwzTvqOSuwn0Xuj","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":1319,"width":2000},"size":543631},"fileName":"WB-HP3-prisoner-of-azkaban-lupin-and-harry-bridge.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/6YCj4uxMwzTvqOSuwn0Xuj/ea44ca744b94777a52cb90d7716f3d90/WB-HP3-prisoner-of-azkaban-lupin-and-harry-bridge.jpg"},"title":"WB-HP3-prisoner-of-azkaban-lupin-and-harry-bridge"}},"twitterCardImage":{"_updatedAt":"2020-08-04T09:51:05.179000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"2nq3BdnSQ9rpBH8KCa5pNE","entryTitle":"WB-HP3-prisoner-of-azkaban-lupin-and-harry-bridge","image":{"_updatedAt":"2020-08-04T09:51:00.435000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"6YCj4uxMwzTvqOSuwn0Xuj","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":1319,"width":2000},"size":543631},"fileName":"WB-HP3-prisoner-of-azkaban-lupin-and-harry-bridge.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/6YCj4uxMwzTvqOSuwn0Xuj/ea44ca744b94777a52cb90d7716f3d90/WB-HP3-prisoner-of-azkaban-lupin-and-harry-bridge.jpg"},"title":"WB-HP3-prisoner-of-azkaban-lupin-and-harry-bridge"}}},"contentTypeId":"article","__typename":"ContentDoc"},{"id":"1lsf3kbaxeF32jFdEKZxz0:en-GB","body":{"_updatedAt":"2020-07-30T14:23:33.265000","activationDate":"2020-07-29T23:00:00","author":{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:07:32.943000","contentTypeId":"author","contentfulId":"3moP55ZKIanB6wWwRtA4Ea","displayTitle":"Written by","entryTitle":"Signature-WizardingWorld","mainImage":{"_updatedAt":"2019-08-01T11:07:44.068000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"30OscCI83JoLGsI4MKRnJS","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":360,"width":360},"size":36037},"fileName":"WizardingWorldLogo.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/30OscCI83JoLGsI4MKRnJS/2ebebe784733ba3b6a185a8e404e57f7/WizardingWorldLogo.jpg"},"title":"Signature_Logo_WizardingWorld"},"title":"The Wizarding World Team"},"contentTypeId":"article","contentfulId":"1lsf3kbaxeF32jFdEKZxz0","displayTitle":"What if Neville had become the Chosen One?","entryTitle":"2020-WEB-ARTICLE-what-if-neville-was-chosen-one","externalId":"what-if-neville-was-the-chosen-one","intro":"It’s a question that so many fans often ponder about, and so do we.

It might have been handy, too, if Harry had known of Dumbledore’s friendship with Grindelwald. Given that for most of *Half-Blood Prince*, Dumbledore knew that he was dying, why didn’t he just tell Harry that he was a horcrux or that Snape was in love with Lily? \n\nOf course, there are a multitude of reasons for why Dumbledore didn’t share these facts – the biggest being that, despite his incredible mind, he was fallible like the rest of us. Still, it’s intriguing to wonder what might have happened had Dumbledore divulged some secrets. In fact, if we had a Time-Turner wouldn’t it be fun to go back and see what might have occurred if Dumbledore had shared more details with Harry? For example: what if Dumbledore had told Harry from the beginning that he was the Chosen One? \n\nNaturally, given that at the beginning of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone* Harry didn’t even know that he was from the wizarding world, it might have been information overload for an 11-year-old to be told not only could he use magic but that he was also at the centre of a prophecy in which either he or the darkest wizard of all time would have to die in order for either of them to survive. \n\nHowever, by the end of that first book, Harry had faced and, at least for that moment, defeated Voldemort. Lying in the hospital wing after his confrontation, he is visited by Dumbledore, who, when quizzed, is unable to tell Harry why Voldemort tried to kill him in the first place. “When you are ready,” Dumbledore says, “you will know.” \n\n"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T18:11:26.652000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"Y33IerJfIkymieioMKuM0-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-HarryPotter WB F1 HarryRevealingHisScarOnHogwartsExpress Still 080615 Land pHhI6gyUWySciWU6ymQ80","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:28:35.169000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"Y33IerJfIkymieioMKuM0","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":1764,"width":3000},"size":646022},"fileName":"HarryPotter_WB_F1_HarryRevealingHisScarOnHogwartsExpress_Still_080615_Land.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/Y33IerJfIkymieioMKuM0/044f2ad4ad1bed1a810ad7ad42ed3db5/HarryPotter_WB_F1_HarryRevealingHisScarOnHogwartsExpress_Still_080615_Land.jpg"},"title":"HarryPotter WB F1 HarryRevealingHisScarOnHogwartsExpress Still 080615 Land"},"imageAltText":"Harry showing his scar to Ron on the Hogwarts Express ","imageCaption":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-01-23T14:09:50.733000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"2rIdBfyU9pvGd3KwnRjUqB","entryTitle":"what-if-dumbledore-had-told-harry-that-he-was-the-chosen-one-from-the-beginning-text-section-2","text":"Imagine, though, that in that moment, Dumbledore – the only person with knowledge of the true prophecy – had shared that information with Harry. Well, it would have changed everything. \n\nIt’s not unfair to say that Harry has a hero complex. If you take *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, instead of really trying to alert the Order about his visions of Sirius at the Department of Mysteries, he takes the word of a miserable house-elf and heads to London, putting him, his friends and the Order at risk. If Harry had already known about the prophecy, his eagerness to help may have been tempered. In fact, it could have ultimately saved Sirius.\n\nWith that knowledge, Harry might actually have focused on learning Occlumency, too. While his connection to Voldemort saved Arthur Weasley’s life, it also put numerous people at risk, Harry included. It might also have saved a lot of angst in *Order of the Phoenix* as Dumbledore wouldn’t have had to give Harry the cold shoulder for a year. \n"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T18:35:42.697000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"5QGggMmHEkcemCYM4io8aG-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-Voldemort WB F5 VoldemortInMinistryOfMagic Still 080615 Land 6YmafSb4eQk4eIK2oQGEQs-b5","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:38:00.911000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"5QGggMmHEkcemCYM4io8aG","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":2080,"width":3450},"size":1828053},"fileName":"Voldemort_WB_F5_VoldemortInMinistryOfMagic_Still_080615_Land.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/5QGggMmHEkcemCYM4io8aG/90aaab9801d5ac1fd566e59f2a21d499/Voldemort_WB_F5_VoldemortInMinistryOfMagic_Still_080615_Land.jpg"},"title":"Voldemort WB F5 VoldemortInMinistryOfMagic Still 080615 Land"},"imageAltText":"Voldemort holding his wand in the Ministry of Magic from the Order of the Phoneix ","imageCaption":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-01-23T14:12:15.305000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"xvkg452xJAlVUnEz1GsC5","entryTitle":"what-if-dumbledore-had-told-harry-that-he-was-the-chosen-one-from-the-beginning-text-section-3","text":"Indeed, with the foresight that he would one day have to vanquish Voldemort or perish himself, you can’t help but wonder whether Harry might have held on to a smidgen of self-preservation.

Snape always called him arrogant, and there’s every chance that knowledge of the prophecy could have gestated inside Harry, giving him an inflamed sense of importance. Who knows what an enlarged ego could have done to Harry Potter. It’s likely he may have turned out like Gilderoy Lockhart, leaning into his celebrity. Such a profile would make it easy for the Ministry of Magic to use Harry as their pawn, and when Voldemort ultimately returned (which, no matter the order of events, would have happened), it’s debatable whether the wizarding world would have had the capacity to fight him off. Certainly, there would have been no Dumbledore’s Army. Likewise, would Harry have the humility to face Voldemort and sacrifice himself if, for his entire adolescence, he was told how important he was? \n\nIn choosing not to tell Harry about just how significant he is in the battle against Voldemort, Dumbledore makes a wider decision, one that helps Harry become the man he needs to be in order to overcome the difficult choices he has to make to save the wizarding world. And while it’s easy to see how Dumbledore’s omission of the truth incurred additional trauma upon the Boy Who Lived, it’s also clear that Harry had to experience the things he did in order to fully realise what was at stake. \n\n'Can you forgive me?', Dumbledore asks Harry in the ‘Kings Cross’ chapter in *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*. 'Can you forgive me for not trusting you? [...] I only feared that you would fail as I had failed.' \n\nWhile he is talking about withholding the knowledge of the Deathly Hallows, it could easily apply to the prophecy, too. Dumbledore’s knowledge about the Chosen One didn’t stop Voldemort from killing Harry’s parents, nor the wrongful incarceration of Sirius Black. He didn’t stop Voldemort’s reign of terror, either. Instead, a baby boy, protected by his mother’s love, did it. It took Harry not knowing to get him to a position where knowing wouldn’t set him on the wrong path. Most likely, Dumbledore knew that all along.

Here's how things might have been different if Snape was never sorted into Slytherin. \n\nFirstly, a quick disclaimer for the proud snakes out there. We know that Slytherin is a great house. It is for the smart, the ambitious and the quick-thinking, and it deserves to be respected. However, back in the day when Voldemort was growing in power and gaining followers, Slytherin's reputation became murky. Salazar Slytherin's influence on the house also encouraged certain students to carry the thoughts that 'pure bloods' were somehow better than others, from Tom Riddle - all the way up to Malfoy 50 years later."},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T19:03:05.041000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"4NEblE5MEEwI0OOEaueaQG-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-WB F8 Severus Lily young flashback by tree HPDH2-07982 65q4crzruoYMmwG0u2eSeA-b6","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:21:55.255000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"4NEblE5MEEwI0OOEaueaQG","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":3000,"width":4500},"size":2898579},"fileName":"WB F8 Severus Lily young flashback by tree HPDH2-07982.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/4NEblE5MEEwI0OOEaueaQG/24e8fe83d8cc702374e6dd5653ede37e/WB_F8_Severus_Lily_young_flashback_by_tree_HPDH2-07982.jpg"},"title":"WB F8 Severus Lily young flashback by tree HPDH2-07982"},"imageCaption":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-01-14T16:42:18.526000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"2ZRRyMRGbBauVKsuupF0KV","entryTitle":"what-if-snape-was-never-sorted-into-slytherin-text-section-2","text":"When Snape first met Lily, the pair instantly hit it off and became very close, with Severus sharing everything with her: from what she needed to know about magic, to his own unhappy home life.

Mulciber! \n\nIf he had been sorted into Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Gryffindor, perhaps Snape stood a chance at making a much safer choice of pals.

But what if, indeed... \n\u003cbr\u003e\n## ‘As the seventh month dies’ \n\n![WB-F5-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-dumbledore-in-his-office](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/3q3GrHeA28mnLmDlwvW8Ty/84a7411ee8500dacaa29d679508ea786/WB-F5-order-of-the-phoenix-harry-dumbledore-in-his-office.jpg)\n \nIn *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, Harry is faced with a shocking revelation: his fate with Lord Voldemort was always sealed. It was told in a prophecy when he was just a baby.  \n \n\u003e‘The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches … born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies … and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not … and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives … the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies …’\n\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Sybill Trelawney, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*\n \nIn one of Professor Trelawney’s rare prophecies that actually came to pass, she spoke of ‘the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord’, with a specific description of who that could be. Although the prophecy was told to Albus Dumbledore, quite unexpectedly in a pub no less, Severus Snape overheard it, relayed the information back to Lord Voldemort, who, in turn, interpreted this mysterious future assassin to be Lily and James Potter’s child. However, as Dumbledore explains to Harry, it could have meant another. Neville Longbottom, Harry’s classmate, was also born at the end of July, and also born to parents who had thrice defied Lord Voldemort. \n\nNonetheless, Voldemort picked Harry for the reasons Dumbledore theorises here. \n\n\u003e ‘But he might have chosen wrong!’ said Harry. ‘He might have marked the wrong person!’ \n\u003e\n\u003e ‘He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,’ said Dumbledore. ‘And notice this, Harry: he chose, not the pureblood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing) but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far – something that neither your parents, nor Neville’s parents, ever achieved.’  \n\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*\n \nSo, that was that. But what if the variables were different, and it had been Neville, who also grew up to play a vital part in Lord Voldemort’s eventual defeat?  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Would Neville’s parents have died, like Harry’s did? And would Voldemort still have fallen? \n\n![HP7-deathly-hallows-part-one-harry-hermione-visit-james-and-lily-potters-grave](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/1ZdV4qSU1OLSrJvMA2j0eW/033190271c51fbbb9cf6bfb0712bcf70/HP7-deathly-hallows-part-one-harry-hermione-visit-james-and-lily-potters-grave.jpg)\n \nMuch like Harry, Neville also grew up without his parents, albeit in a very different sort of way. While [both his mum, Alice, and dad, Frank](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/unsung-heroes-of-harry-potter-stories-frank-and-alice-longbottom), were still alive, they had been tortured to insanity by Death Eaters soon after Lord Voldemort’s fall from power and spent the rest of their days at St Mungo’s Hospital. But if Neville’s family had been targeted, and Lord Voldemort had gone after them instead, there is a chance that the Longbottoms could’ve been killed straight after Lord Voldemort learnt of the prophecy. After all, the Potters had been hidden by Albus Dumbledore, after Snape tipped him off and begged him to try and protect the woman he loved, Lily. \n \nSnape did not have the same connection to the Longbottoms, and may well have not interfered, meaning nobody would’ve known the attack on them was coming. Although, perhaps Albus Dumbledore, after hearing the prophecy, would’ve put his own protective measures in place on both families (the Longbottoms and the Potters) anyway. But even without a Peter Pettigrew-type to betray anybody, Lord Voldemort has his ways of finding people. And there are no guarantees that Neville’s parents wouldn’t have tried to protect their son in a similar way that Harry’s parents did. Would a similar protective magic, forged from love, have saved Neville?  \n \nIt’s quite possible. Dumbledore does explain to Harry that Lord Voldemort went to Godric’s Hollow not knowing that by going to attack Harry, there would be a possibility the event would end in his downfall. This is because Snape never heard the entire prophecy. \n \n\u003e‘He heard only the beginning, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. \n\u003e\n\u003eConsequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you, and marking you as his equal. So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait, to learn more. He did not know that you would have power the Dark Lord knows not –’ \n\u003e \u003cbr\u003e*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*  \n \nSo, if Lord Voldemort *had* chosen Neville, maybe a similar phenomenon would have occurred... \n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Would Neville still have been friends with Harry, Ron and Hermione? And would they have all been friends? \n\n![WB-F8-Deathly-Hallows-Neville-Harry-Ron-Hermione-enter-Hogs-Head](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/5RRBIPJGEQP8Eq1AXXD4Wq/64934a156e0e5f6efa906110a100efe7/WB-F8-Deathly-Hallows-Neville-Harry-Ron-Hermione-enter-Hogs-Head.jpg)\n \nLet’s say it did, and Lord Voldemort *was* still thwarted, and it *was* poor Neville who lost his parents, not Harry. Unlike Harry, Neville would’ve still grown up knowing he was a wizard, as [presumably his grandmother Augusta](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/harry-potter-characters-we-would-like-to-learn-more-about) would’ve still taken care of him.  \n \nAnd maybe we can also assume Neville would’ve still been the same nervous, clumsy child if he was still brought up by his strict, often chiding, grandmother. And let’s assume he was still in Gryffindor. What is not clear is how Harry’s life would’ve been different, and how that would’ve dictated events.  \n \nBeyond that, what would Harry’s Hogwarts experience have been like? Would he still have pursued the same interests, still joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team? Still fallen for Ginny? Malfoy wouldn’t have bothered him so much without his fame, surely. And would he still have been friends with Ron and Hermione? Harry’s parents certainly knew the Weasleys, at any rate. But either way, we imagine Harry and Neville would’ve both still been in Gryffindor, and hence would’ve become friends through their house. And we simply can’t imagine a world where Harry and Ron don’t befriend each other eventually. And no matter what timeline of events – the defiant Hermione would always team up with Neville to find his lost toad, Trevor. So those friendships may have found a way...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## How would Neville have dealt with Harry’s Hogwarts adventures? \n\n![WB-F5-neville-and-dumbledores-army](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/4C5Cb8NebT41WTvfUB2b7H/5a6236dc838f7e80b5e6a5cec5d5a53b/WB-F5-neville-and-dumbledores-army.jpg)\n \nFinding the Philosopher’s Stone... Discovering the mysteries of the Chamber of Secrets... Taking part in the Triwizard Tournament... It's a lot. And in his younger years, lovely Neville was definitely not the first Hogwarts student that leapt to mind when it came to saving the castle from certain peril, or indeed, dodging Hungarian Horntails. He could barely keep Trevor under control, let alone a giant, scaly dragon. \n \nNeville only truly came into his own when Harry, Ron and Hermione started up Dumbledore’s Army in their fifth year. And it’s not likely Harry would’ve started up Dumbledore’s Army if he’d been living a considerably calmer Hogwarts life, not having had to learn extra defensive spells, not having had to grow up far quicker than usual with the looming threat of a Dark wizard on his back. But it’s possible Umbridge would’ve still been around, and some sort of alliance would’ve still been needed. Maybe Hermione, who we can definitely still see being friends with Neville, would’ve started it up with Neville in tow? \n\nIn fact, with all of the challenges Harry faced at Hogwarts and beyond, he had his friends (friends like Neville!) to help him. We can only imagine Neville would've got the same support network.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\n## And how would things have ended? \n\n![NevilleLongbottom WB F8 NevilleHoldingSwordOfGryffindorAtHogwarts Still 100615 Land](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/3TG2z3LcOkOuC6qswm6sWC/46e4a3ce08a8e39d063efd9c4c18db61/NevilleLongbottom_WB_F8_NevilleHoldingSwordOfGryffindorAtHogwarts_Still_100615_Land.jpg)\n \nWhen all is said and done, Lord Voldemort would’ve still had his Horcruxes, and Neville would’ve still known that neither must live while the other survives. We imagine Dumbledore would’ve still tutored Neville about Voldemort’s history – and we can still imagine Dumbledore dying, albeit maybe through Malfoy or the Death Eaters rather than Snape. More on Snape in a moment.  \n \nWith the assumption Hermione and Neville would’ve still been friends... and Neville’s growing confidence shaping him into a great wizard... it is feasible Neville would’ve still fulfilled the prophecy. And if Harry ever found out that it could’ve been him, you’d have to think that he would’ve been on hand to help Neville?  \n \nOf course, we’ll never truly know what would have really happened, but never forget the courage that Neville displayed, from a young, nervous first-year trying to stop Harry Potter sneaking around Hogwarts to a war-beaten hero who destroyed one of Lord Voldemort’s most precious Horcruxes. No matter what the prophecy truly meant, Neville would always have a huge part to play in the battle against darkness in the Wizarding World.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n## A note about Snape  \n \nWe can’t help but think about how Severus Snape’s life might’ve changed during this altered chain of events, especially as it could’ve resulted in Lily Potter never dying. In our eyes, we can imagine Lily and James would’ve continued to be married happily, and perhaps Snape would’ve simply continued to support Voldemort and never become a double-spy for Dumbledore. After all, his love of Lily and the grief of losing her is very much what shaped Snape’s story. Without that grief driving him on, would Snape really have changed his ways? Maybe that’s a conversation for another day...

But we heard about this adorable dad moment in a letter Lily Potter wrote to Harry’s godfather, Sirius Black. Here’s when Harry saw the enclosed photograph: \n\n\u003e 'A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James were chasing after him.' \n\nWe’re so glad that Harry found this carefree photograph of himself and his dad – especially as it showed an early shared love of Quidditch. A special shout-out should also go to Sirius Black whilst we’re talking about Harry. Sirius was a real father figure for the Boy Who Lived – and it’s lovely to read in Lily’s letter that Sirius bought this baby broomstick for Harry, just like he bought him his Firebolt in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Arthur Weasley \n\nThere are plenty of amazing examples of Arthur Weasley being a wizarding dad to be proud of, from hilariously asking the twins whether his flying car went alright, to standing up to Lucius Malfoy in Flourish and Blotts. But we’ve chosen a more emotional moment – one that shows the power of this father’s love, even when his son, Percy, had made an awful lot of mistakes: \n\n\u003e “I’m sorry, Dad,’ Percy said. \n\u003e\n\u003e Mr Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he, too, hurried to hug his son.'\n\nThis reunion came in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, when Percy finally saw the error of his ways at the Ministry. Of all the family, we think Mr Weasley probably suffered the most when it came to Percy’s betrayal. It must have been so difficult for Arthur having to see Percy every day at the Ministry of Magic, and have his own son ignore him. The power of forgiveness really was demonstrated by this hug between father and son.  \n\n![arthur-weasley-article-image](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/5kFBOzbB361iZkZxEYFZil/3032727a4093f8f0ae333e6a05088a17/arthur.png)\n\n## Xenophilius Lovegood \n\nXenophilius Lovegood might have been an unconventional dad, but the bond between him and his daughter, Luna was strong and beautiful. We loved this moment at Bill and Fleur’s wedding in Deathly Hallows (when you read it, you have to picture them wearing their matching bright yellow outfits!): \n\n\u003e “Bidding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, ‘Daddy, look – one of the gnomes actually bit me!’ \n\u003e \n\u003e ‘How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!’ said Mr Lovegood…'\n\nAs we said, unconventional but very loving, Xenophilius and Luna really understood each other. And when it came down to saving his daughter later on in Deathly Hallows, there was nothing Xenophilius wouldn’t do to get Luna back – even betray the Chosen One.\n\n![xenophilius-lovegood-article-insert](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/4iu3neqXbSsN0CLCI2tT8h/15eb97d76e4dfa8667c3aba8c8513835/xeno.png)\n\n## Amos Diggory  \n\nCedric might have been a shining example of a humble Hufflepuff, but Amos wasn’t at all shy about telling everyone just how wonderful his son was. Here’s how it went down when Amos met Harry in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and the subject of that Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match came up: \n\n\u003e “Harry fell off his broom, Dad,’ he muttered. ‘I told you ... it was an accident ...’ \n\u003e\n\u003e ‘Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?’ roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back. ‘Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same, wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don’t need to be a genius to tell which one’s the better flier!” \n\nIt was a little embarrassing for Cedric, but we loved the moment this father was bursting with pride at his son out-flying the famous Harry Potter.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Remus Lupin \n\nLike James Potter, Lupin didn’t get long with his son, Teddy but we wanted to shine a light on a lovely dad moment of Lupin’s, not long after Tonks gave birth to their son: \n\n\u003e “I can’t stay long, I must get back,’ said Lupin, beaming around at them all: he looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. ‘Thank you, thank you, Bill.’ \n\u003e\n\u003e Bill had soon filled all of their goblets; they stood and raised them high in a toast. \n\u003e\n\u003e ‘To Teddy Remus Lupin,’ said Lupin, ‘a great wizard in the making!” \n\nLupin had been extremely worried about Tonks’ pregnancy, given he was a werewolf – so it’s no wonder he stayed at Shell Cottage to toast his son in celebration. And we’re sure anyone, whether they’ve been a new parent or not, can relate to Lupin’s unbridled joy at the birth of his child. Heart-warming, or what? \n\n![lupin-article-web-insert](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/4y0DD9NtRBZmfYkNEfUP3z/3e9d83c585ec07f1c72f5674b02fbc5f/lupin.png)\n\n## Harry Potter   \n\nIn the final chapter of Deathly Hallows, we got a glimpse of Harry Potter, the father. And he had some particularly sage advice for his son, Albus, who was worrying that he’d be sorted into Slytherin: \n\n\u003e \"But just say –’ \n\u003e\n\u003e ‘– then Slytherin house will have gained an excellent student, won’t it? It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.’ \n\u003e\n\u003e ‘Really?’ \n\u003e\n\u003e ‘It did for me,’ said Harry.' \n\nSeeing the worry about being sorted into Slytherin in Harry’s son was a really special moment – something shared across time and generations. We loved that Harry could help Albus as he boarded the Hogwarts Express, in a way his own parents weren’t able to, and share this piece of wisdom from his own Hogwarts journey. It really is enough to bring a tear to anyone’s eye!  \n\nGo wizard Dads! \n\n "}],"tags":[{"_updatedAt":"2019-08-01T11:51:53.952000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"3B1lhNkNAFaVH3lS0WLMxV","name":"feature"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:07:02.831000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"L1Cef6BUiA2eC84VPklgq","name":"hide-from-app"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:06:54.732000","authorComment":"This excludes the content item from its index page i.e. quizzes run to Quiz section automatically, but for other Quiz content (publishing elsewhere) it excludes from Discover.

Weirdest of all was that Luna seemed to see right through Harry’s Polyjuice disguise. Well, she is a Ravenclaw.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 7 – That time Newt impersonated his brother to get into the French Ministry of Magic\n\nIn an alley outside the Ministry of Magic in Paris, Newt took out a tiny bottle containing a small amount of Polyjuice Potion. Luckily, he was able to find a hair belonging to his brother, Theseus, and changed into him to make it through the doors with Tina. Unfortunately, he was then spotted by the real Theseus, and the Polyjuice Potion wore off in very little time …\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## 6 – That time it was used by a Death Eater everyone thought was dead\n\nIt wasn’t as though Mad-Eye Moody’s teaching style at Hogwarts was exactly normal, and sure, he did keep swigging something out of a hip-flask.

What a plot twist therefore, when it turned out that not only was he NOT the real Mad-Eye Moody, but he was Barty Crouch junior, who everyone thought had died a year after he entered Azkaban prison.

Harry Potter’s son impersonating Ron Weasley, and Draco Malfoy’s son impersonating … just wait for it … Harry Potter! Priceless. And what were they doing? Sneaking into the Ministry of Magic, of course!\n\n## 4 – That time Hermione impersonated Bellatrix Lestrange\n\nIt was all for a good cause – breaking into the Lestrange vault – but we have to admit it was downright disturbing when Hermione Granger took Polyjuice Potion so she could trick the Gringotts goblins into thinking she was one of Voldemort’s closest Death Eaters. Though we did love that on this Polyjuice adventure, Hermione had to be reminded not to be too polite!\n\n![HP-F7-hermione-bellatrix-polyjuice](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/5nmOktj46TPEU9Jq4pxtVk/f4bfa3505ca1330cf73ae5892b0b8eb3/bellatrix_ron_hermione.png)\n\n\n## 3 – That time Hermione got herself a tail…\n\nAh yes. The first time we ever met Polyjuice Potion. Brewed by Hermione of course in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Harry and Ron changed into Crabbe and Goyle, but unfortunately the hair that Hermione had taken from Millicent Bulstrode’s robes actually belonged to her cat. Given Polyjuice Potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations, Hermione had a rather furry surprise…\n\n## 2 – That time the Golden Trio used Polyjuice Potion to break into the Ministry of Magic\n\nMafalda Hopkirk, Reg Cattermole and Albert Runcorn – otherwise known as the three Ministry of Magic employees Hermione, Ron and Harry changed into in order to get into the Ministry and locate Slytherin’s locket. This adventure almost came top of the rankings, with its nail-biting and hilarious twists in equal measure. Ron accidentally got himself a wife, Hermione was taken down to the courtroom to assist Umbridge, and Harry accidentally chose one of the nastiest Death Eaters to impersonate.

Seven of Harry’s friends and allies volunteered to change into him for the flight, in an attempt to confuse the Death Eaters as to the true Potter’s identity. We loved this moment for the lightness it brought to a very dangerous situation. Remember when Fred and George drank it down and said, ‘Wow - we’re identical!’? And when Fleur said, ‘Bill, don’t look at me – I’m ’ideous.’ Unlucky Harry! But we also loved it for what it said about friendship and loyalty. Harry’s friends were willing to turn into him – the person Voldemort wanted to capture the most – in order to protect him.\n\n![HP-F7-seven-harrys-polyjuce](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/3L4z1Z3Uk0DnJTgGRXHDop/323aa68fb464b6dad8b5c528453a06b8/polyjuice.png)"}],"tags":[{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:07:02.831000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"L1Cef6BUiA2eC84VPklgq","name":"hide-from-app"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-08-01T11:51:53.952000","contentTypeId":"tag","contentfulId":"3B1lhNkNAFaVH3lS0WLMxV","name":"feature"}]},"contentTypeId":"article","__typename":"ContentDoc"},{"id":"1YvdK0CGgFa0YCdtstGjiI:en-GB","body":{"_updatedAt":"2020-07-23T13:50:17.721000","activationDate":"2020-07-22T23:00:00","author":{"_updatedAt":"2020-02-20T13:07:32.943000","contentTypeId":"author","contentfulId":"3moP55ZKIanB6wWwRtA4Ea","displayTitle":"Written by","entryTitle":"Signature-WizardingWorld","mainImage":{"_updatedAt":"2019-08-01T11:07:44.068000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"30OscCI83JoLGsI4MKRnJS","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":360,"width":360},"size":36037},"fileName":"WizardingWorldLogo.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/30OscCI83JoLGsI4MKRnJS/2ebebe784733ba3b6a185a8e404e57f7/WizardingWorldLogo.jpg"},"title":"Signature_Logo_WizardingWorld"},"title":"The Wizarding World Team"},"contentTypeId":"article","contentfulId":"1YvdK0CGgFa0YCdtstGjiI","displayTitle":"Learn how to make your own lightning bolt keyring","entryTitle":"WEB-FEATURE-2020-learn-how-to-make-your-own-lightning-bolt-keyring","externalId":"learn-how-to-make-your-own-lightning-bolt-keyring","intro":"Calling all fans of Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived!

But once he met Hagrid, Harry’s relationship with his scar began to change. Not only did he find out that it was a mark made by Dark magic and by his parents’ murderer, but he also realised that it was a mark that made him recognisable. Time and time again through *Philosopher’s Stone*, it was Harry’s scar that identified him as the Boy Who Lived, identified him as an orphan, or even a victim, of Lord Voldemort. Harry’s scar also changed from dormant to active throughout the first book. Whilst he was growing up, it was merely part of his appearance, but soon after his arrival at Hogwarts it started to cause him physical pain. With his entry into the wizarding world, it was almost as though the scar came alive, and with its awakening came a searing pain in Harry’s forehead that would follow him for many years to come.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nIn his second year, comments by Lockhart and Malfoy, emphasised to Harry that his scar was the physical sign that brought him fame and attention that he didn’t want at all. It was part of the tale of Harry Potter that he couldn’t even remember, adding to the mystery surrounding him – when all he really wanted to be known for was catching the Snitch. It wasn’t until Tom Riddle’s diary had been destroyed that Harry’s relationship with his scar shifted again – towards Voldemort. Dumbledore told Harry that ‘*Unless I’m much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar*’. Harry could speak Parseltongue; the Sorting Hat tried to put him in Slytherin – Harry learned that the scar wasn’t just linked to his past– it was linked to his present, and to a Voldemort who was determined to return.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nIn *Prisoner of Azkaban*, Harry became increasingly irritated with his scar. Running away from the Dursleys after he’d blown up Aunt Marge, Harry was barely able to conceal his identity from Stan Shunpike on the Knight Bus, and was then exposed once Fudge collected him and Stan was able to see the mark clearly: ‘I can see ‘is scar’. Gawping at Harry’s scar, which didn’t seem to bother Harry that much in the first two books, in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, became something he wanted to absolutely avoid: ‘*Er – no, thanks, Colin,’ said Harry, who wasn’t in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead’.*\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\n*Goblet of Fire* was the first time that the pain in Harry’s scar caused him real anxiety. In his first year at Hogwarts, he’d put his scar hurting down to being a ‘warning’ and then, of course, he’d come face-to-face with Lord Voldemort, which had made sense of it all. But in *Goblet of Fire* his scar started to hurt whilst he was in Privet Drive, with no Voldemort in sight. It was something new… and more threatening, and Harry’s relationship with his scar shifted again. But despite this, Harry’s scar hurting was something he first tried to keep to himself – at the beginning of *Goblet of Fire* he didn’t want to worry Ron, Hermione, even Dumbledore – the pain alienated him, and he isolated himself with it – though he was unable to keep his friends in the dark for long even though he might have preferred to. The pain, coupled by his dreams that seemed to link to Voldemort, started to mean that more than ever Harry’s scar was becoming a living link to Lord Voldemort. And when he was finally confronted with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the graveyard, the pain in Harry’s scar was excruciating, unbearable – something that Lord Voldemort could use against him.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nThis idea of his scar as a weakness was something that solidified in *Order of the Phoenix*. Whilst Harry had previously viewed his scar as something to be proud of, the scar was now not only causing him physical pain, but emotional trauma too. Throughout his fifth year at Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic used it as a way to discredit and mock him. The Daily Prophet, following Rita Skeeter’s article about Harry collapsing all over the place, included lines such as, ‘*Let’s hope he hasn’t got a scar on his forehead or we’ll be asked to worship him next*’. Whilst in previous years, pain in Harry’s scar had been something unusual, in *Order of the Phoenix*, the prickling sensation in his forehead became commonplace, a constant reminder that Lord Voldemort had returned – contrary to the lies the Ministry were disseminating. In short, Harry’s relationship with his scar – with the varying levels of pain that came with visions, dreams, Voldemort’s emotions, and Ministry mockery – took over his whole life. This was something that came out in anger when Hermione urges him to tell Dumbledore that it’s hurting: ‘*Yeah,’ said Harry, before he could stop himself, ‘that’s the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about, isn’t it, my scar?’* He wasn’t the boy with the scar anymore, the scar was defining him.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nAt the end of *Order of the Phoenix*, Harry found out more about his scar and what Dumbledore had been keeping from him about it for years, and this changed his relationship with the mark of Dark magic even further. Dumbledore revealed these particular words of the Prophecy that were relevant to the scar: ‘*and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not…*’ And Harry could not stop thinking about the fact that Neville Longbottom could have been marked with the scar instead, could have been the boy whose family Voldemort decided to hunt down.\n\nHalf-Blood Prince was where it really sunk in for Harry that his scar wasn’t just meant for the past, it marked him as the one who must kill Lord Voldemort – ‘*neither can live whilst the other survives*’. The scar wasn’t just a battle-wound anymore; it was a target.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nA poignant moment at Bill and Fleur’s wedding near the beginning of *Deathly Hallows* was Harry harking back to time spent with Ginny at the end of Half-Blood Prince. Watching the ceremony, Harry equated having a normal life, with one without a scar: … ‘*he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person’s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead ...*’ Harry’s relationship with his scar at this point was not one he prized – it hadn’t been for a long time – but one that he wished he didn’t have. The scar was now intrinsically linked to finding the Horcruxes, destroying Voldemort, and walking the path Dumbledore set for him.\n\nInterestingly in *Deathly Hallows*, the connection with Voldemort’s thoughts and even actions that so plagued Harry in Order of the Phoenix, started to become a source of strength and knowledge for him. He used the insights into You-Know-Who’s emotions and whereabouts to assist in his own hunt for the Horcruxes and Hallows. For the first time since *Philosopher’s Stone*, Harry’s relationship with his scar became slightly more positive, useful – a warning, again. And then, as he buried Dobby, Harry gained something else: control – ‘*On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar*’.\n\nAt King’s Cross, meeting Dumbledore again, Harry’s scar actually disappeared. He had wished it gone so many times. But, as we know, Harry decided to return; return to fight Voldemort and regain the scar on his head and enter battle once again. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n## Nineteen years later\n\nNineteen years later, the relationship between Harry and his scar was still there, in the background, but the scar was dormant again, more like the thin lightning bolt that was once the only thing the boy Harry Potter liked about his appearance. But in adult Harry Potter, its silence also signals an end to Harry’s trials and troubles in the wizarding world: *‘The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well’.*\n\nWant to watch to Noma Dumezweni reading Chapter Two of Philosopher’s Stone, where we hear the first ever description of Harry’s lightning bolt scar?

He abandoned Harry and Hermione on their hunt for Horcruxes.  \n\nWe found out once he returned, of course, that he almost immediately regretted his decision and wanted to come back. Ron told Harry and Hermione that he’d heard Hermione’s voice somehow. And that a ball of light from the Deluminator had guided him – had floated right into his chest, right by his heart and brought him back to them.  \n\nHarry mulls this over when thinking about Dumbledore: *‘You gave Ron the Deluminator. You understood him ... you gave him a way back ...’* And now we’re mulling it over too. What exactly did Dumbledore understand about the youngest Weasley brother? Were there any clues in Ron’s life at Hogwarts, from his personality, from the trials and tribulations he’d faced, that meant he was going to leave his friends – but always want to return?  \n\nYoung Ron Weasley was a firm friend to Harry Potter from the start, though he was unsure of himself and his family – within moments of meeting Harry he defended his mum making him sandwiches, uncomfortably saying she didn’t have a lot of time. This feeling of inadequacy followed Ron around right from the start – not helped by Draco Malfoy spouting things like: ‘*No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles and more children than they can afford.’*\n\nAnd it wasn’t just other witches and wizards Ron couldn’t help but compare himself too. Ron had his five older brothers to contend with. Once he arrived at Hogwarts, Percy was already a Prefect, and later became Head Boy. Fred and George were known for being hilarious but also played excellently on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Not to mention that Bill was also Head Boy and Charlie was captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in their Hogwarts years. Unsurprising therefore that young Ron Weasley saw himself as the best of all his brothers in the Mirror of Erised – succeeding as they had and more – revealing the depth of the superiority complex he had already no doubt developed.  \n\nBy Harry and Ron’s fourth year, being friends with the famous Harry Potter was starting to grate on Ron, and it became a wedge that drove them apart quickly and easily. Ron had shown his stubbornness and his unwillingness to see a different point of view at times, back in *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* – refusing to speak to Hermione for ages because he thought her cat had killed Scabbers. But then in *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, being in Harry Potter’s shadow became far too much when Harry was somehow entered into the Triwizard Tournament. During their weeks of silence, Hermione tried to explain it to Harry, which gave us a good insight into Ron’s character: *“... Ron’s got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you’re his best friend, and you’re really famous – he’s always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many ...”* \n\n \n\nRon’s superiority complex only got worse with the onset of teenage hormones. And it wasn’t just about Harry specifically anymore, it was anyone. His temper was very easily raised by Ginny teasing him about not having kissed anyone – she used Harry kissing Cho, and Hermione kissing Krum, as examples, which can’t have helped at all. And then suddenly in *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, Harry was the Chosen One, and Ron was… well… still just Ron Weasley, Harry Potter’s best friend. And it just wasn’t enough anymore. Interestingly, this didn’t seem to bother Hermione, but perhaps it was because she – unlike Ron – was hyper logical. She could rationalise out those feelings, whereas Ron was more of an emotional person (some might say hot-headed) – plus, she was an only child and had her own thing – being the brightest witch of her age.  \n\nIt’s likely that the strength of Ron’s superiority complex, combined with his stubbornness, made it easy for someone or something to get inside Ron’s head and make him do some*thing* he didn’t really, at base, want to do. It comes as no surprise therefore that Slytherin’s necklace affected him so badly, and once all those feelings of inadequacy had built up he couldn’t shake them, even without the necklace on.  \n\nBut Dumbledore giving Ron the Deluminator wasn’t just about him being the most likely of the Golden Trio to walk away from the other three. It was about him wanting to come back – after all, why give someone a magical object that means they can return to those they love, if they’re not going to use it? Of course we can only guess, but it’s hard to imagine Hermione – once she’d made up her mind – going back on a decision to leave, as she would have reasoned the whole thing out far too hard for that. \n\nRon was brave, like a true Gryffindor, but he was also very humble. It might have taken him a while to apologise when he was angry at Harry or Hermione, but he wasn’t afraid to admit his mistakes. He was also an extremely loyal friend, and always did the right thing, in the end. And Dumbledore would have known this. Even in Ron’s very first year at Hogwarts he volunteered to sacrifice himself in McGonagall’s giant chess game, so that Harry could rescue the Philosopher’s Stone. In *Chamber of Secrets*, he was mortally afraid of spiders but followed Harry into the Forbidden Forest anyway – because he’d  never have thought to truly abandon a friend to their fate. He fought for and alongside his friends time and time again – in Dumbledore’s Army, in the Battle of Hogwarts – and he was afraid, but he fought anyway.  \n\nAnd Dumbledore would have known this too.  \n\nThe Patronuses of witches and wizards take their forms for a reason, and Ron’s terrier is one of the most tenacious, loving and loyal dogs around. Ron might have left Hermione and Harry in a moment of jealousy and bad judgment – but he was always going to come back.

That his mother died to protect him from Voldemort has left more than the protection that lingers in Harry’s skin – it’s also left him with an acute awareness of right and wrong, even if those around him don’t always agree. \n\nFrom that first ride on the [Hogwarts Express](/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-hogwarts-express \"The Hogwarts Express by J.K. Rowling\") to the moments after the final Triwizard task, here are some of Harry’s memorable moral moments:\n\n## When he refused Malfoy’s friendship\n\nAs soon as he meets the sneering, condescending Malfoy, Harry has a bad feeling about him. So when Malfoy turns up in the Hogwarts Express carriage Harry is sharing with Ron, warning Harry not to associate with the ‘wrong sort’, Harry’s reaction is instant. ‘I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,’ he tells Malfoy, aligning himself firmly with Ron. \n\n## When he set off to retrieve the Philosopher’s Stone\n\nWhen Harry, Ron and Hermione become convinced Snape wants to get his hands on the Philosopher’s Stone, they try to enlist the help of a couple of teachers. But Dumbledore’s away and McGonagall won’t listen, so Harry takes it upon himself to rescue the Stone. When Hermione and Ron try to dissuade him, he won’t budge, saying: ‘I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me!’ So they join him instead.\n\n## When he used the Mirror to get the Stone"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T17:29:25.722000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"2n98D1IUsE22Iyc6uySeis-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-MirrorOfErised PM B1C17M1 QuirrellAndHarryInFrontOfTheMirrorOfErised Moment 54xvgNQcAEWQ6g0kUCIkME","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-25T23:24:44.792000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"2n98D1IUsE22Iyc6uySeis","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":1536,"width":4120},"size":439589},"fileName":"MirrorOfErised_PM_B1C17M1_QuirrellAndHarryInFrontOfTheMirrorOfErised_Moment.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/2n98D1IUsE22Iyc6uySeis/ee6f76e220a34516615b4b032c009feb/MirrorOfErised_PM_B1C17M1_QuirrellAndHarryInFrontOfTheMirrorOfErised_Moment.jpg"},"title":"MirrorOfErised PM B1C17M1 QuirrellAndHarryInFrontOfTheMirrorOfErised Moment"},"imageAltText":"Quirrell and Harry in front of the Mirror of Erised.","imageCaption":"© JKR/Pottermore Ltd. ™ Warner Bros."},{"_updatedAt":"2020-07-21T11:20:00.635000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"3qVa9jKTawgQOqimIoqWko-b2","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-BODY-OF-when-harry-potter-got-it-right-2","text":"Dumbledore’s first great Harry-shaped gamble becomes clear when Harry discovers Quirrell in front of the Mirror of Erised trying to get his hands on the Philosopher’s Stone. When Harry stands in front of the Mirror, like Quirrell he sees himself with the Stone – but in Harry’s case this vision comes true, because only a person who wants to find but not use the Stone can get their hands on it. At the age of 11, Harry displays exactly the kind of moral courage Dumbledore has banked on.\n\n## When he saved Justin Finch-Fletchley\n\nWhen a snake conjured up by Malfoy seems about to attack Justin Finch-Fletchley at the end of their first Duelling Club in *Chamber of Secrets*, Harry unthinkingly speaks in Parseltongue, telling the snake to leave Justin alone. It works – at Harry’s words the snake falls docile. It’s just a shame nobody understands Parseltongue, a skill Harry shares with Voldemort and Salazar Slytherin, and therefore they all wrongly think Harry is egging the snake on. \n\n## When he followed the spiders\n\nHagrid’s instruction to ‘follow the spiders’ isn’t something Ron is keen on – it’s Harry who trusts in Hagrid’s instruction and insists they head to the Forbidden Forest. While encountering Aragog and his large family of monstrously huge spiders with a taste for eating people isn’t exactly a picnic, it is worth it for what Aragog tells them about the [Chamber of Secrets](/writing-by-jk-rowling/chamber-of-secrets \"Chamber of Secrets by J.K.

This is despite the fact that Harry has just undertaken a gruelling fight with Voldemort-as-Tom-Riddle. He’s never too exhausted to ignore injustice.\n\n## When he thought he was being followed by a dog\n\nAfter storming out of the Dursley’s house in *Prisoner of Azkaban*, Harry starts seeing a large black dog, seemingly everywhere. It begins to worry him when first Professor Trelawney and then Ron draw comparisons to the Grim, a death omen. Despite Ron’s concerns, Harry is convinced the dog is real and not just a figment of his imagination.

Suspicious. Well, we really thought so. And we felt very protective of poor Harry at this point. We’d barely just found out his parents were killed by a Dark wizard, and that Voldemort gave him the very scar that Snape seemed to have just set alight with pain. Curious, very curious. From that moment on, we decided to keep an eye on Snape. And we didn’t have to try very hard as he looked guilty at every turn!\n\nSnape was awful to Harry in his first ever Potions class for no reason whatsoever – plus there was all his talk about bottling fame, brewing glory, and even putting a stopper in death. Does an innocent person talk like that? Then we noticed – it was very subtle but we noticed it – that Snape was heading to the third floor when Harry and Ron went looking for Hermione and came across the troll. Aha, we thought to ourselves… Snape was certainly up to something fishy. A bit later Snape limped past the Golden Trio, and then Harry heard him talking about something with three heads – he was seriously up to something! Why would anyone get that close to Fluffy? \n\nBut at Harry’s first Quidditch game we started to question ourselves. Snape jinxing Harry’s broom? It didn’t seem very subtle – not exactly up Snape’s street, who was all about the exact art of Potion making. It was bold, it was risky, and surely he could have found easier ways to kill Harry? Hadn’t he already mentioned the Draught of Living Death? Couldn’t he have just slipped that into Harry’s pumpkin juice? The broom jinxing was very public, too obvious… Our conclusion? A double bluff, of course.\n\nIt was so obviously Snape that of course the reader was supposed to go looking for other suspects. Filch, maybe? Or what about someone really innocuous, like poor Quirrell? Yes, that was the garden path the reader was supposed to be led down. And we were not falling for it. We weren’t going to be tricked. Snape was the wannabe thief; we’d known it from the start. And anyway, who were we to argue with Hermione Granger’s logic?\n\nImagine our dismay when it really was Quirrell standing in the last chamber. And he revealed that Snape had actually been trying to stop him stealing the Philosopher’s Stone! \nGive us a break okay, Quirrell might have had Voldemort on the back of his head, but you have to admit, he wasn’t the only man with two faces throughout Philosopher’s Stone.  \n\n## Professor Quirrell \n\nYes, it’s perfectly understandable that Harry, Ron and Hermione, and many, many readers around the world would’ve been convinced that it had to be Snape who wanted the Philosopher’s Stone. His whole, general demeanour seemed to scream that he was no good egg from the moment we met him. But Professor Quirrell didn’t exactly seem like a wholesome, trustworthy sort either. He just presented his shiftiness in a different sort of way.\n"},{"_updatedAt":"2019-10-01T18:48:41.684000","contentTypeId":"image","contentfulId":"1FixBVr7NWoqeMyi6gYUcI-img","entryTitle":"PMARCHIVE-QuirinusQuirrell WB F1 QuirrellInClassroomHoldingLizard Still 080615 Land 4yIk80kd1CKSGSIaqI6oO4","image":{"_updatedAt":"2019-09-24T05:26:05.107000","contentTypeId":"asset","contentfulId":"1FixBVr7NWoqeMyi6gYUcI","file":{"contentType":"image/jpeg","details":{"image":{"height":1950,"width":3000},"size":1007305},"fileName":"QuirinusQuirrell_WB_F1_QuirrellInClassroomHoldingLizard_Still_080615_Land.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/1FixBVr7NWoqeMyi6gYUcI/62eab829b07724c05552ffa631483cd0/QuirinusQuirrell_WB_F1_QuirrellInClassroomHoldingLizard_Still_080615_Land.jpg"},"title":"QuirinusQuirrell WB F1 QuirrellInClassroomHoldingLizard Still 080615 Land"},"imageAltText":"Quirrell teaching in his classroom with a lizard","imageCaption":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone"},{"_updatedAt":"2020-07-16T11:17:25.413000","contentTypeId":"textSection","contentfulId":"18TrWvYAAkIJmga2sAKJJR","entryTitle":"plot-twist-the-man-with-two-faces-text-section-3","text":"From Harry’s very first meeting with the nervy Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Quirrell acted suspiciously. Some may have mistaken his stutter for nervousness... especially after Hagrid’s explanation that he had been perfectly fine before a run-in with vampires and a hag in the Black Forest. But surely this explanation prompted more questions than it did answers? \n\nThings did not improve when Harry got to Hogwarts and experienced Quirrell as a professor. Did you really think this man was perfectly sound? The abundance of garlic in his classroom, for one thing, and the farfetched stories about the origins of Quirrell’s turban, which Quirrell himself often avoided talking about ‘turning pink and talking about the weather’, when asked. \n\nAgain, this could have been mistaken for a man who had come back from his travels deeply disturbed – but he was still supposed to be a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Why so secretive? Why was he specialising in a topic he seemed absolutely terrified of? Even the thought of a troll in the dungeon caused him to faint upon the mere thought. Something never added up about Quirrell being professor of this field, especially considering how knowledgeable all the other staff were about their topics. What was he so afraid of, really?\n\nThe signs were always there that it was Quirrell, not Snape, who was the man with two faces. Even upon Harry’s first night at Hogwarts, he had a dream about wearing Quirrell’s turban, which was acting as the Sorting Hat. Was there something in Harry’s subconscious that led him to question Quirrell too? \n\nWe just couldn’t put our finger on what exactly it was about Quirrell that was giving us pause for thought. While Snape was more outwardly villainous in his actions and the way he spoke, Quirrell’ quietness should not have been so easily overlooked. And he was always with Snape! If Snape was so suspicious, we should have been keeping more of an eye on who he keeps company with, too. If Snape had something to hide, maybe he would’ve been a bit nicer to his students to try and cover up things more, but Snape never had a problem being in the spotlight. Quirrell, on the other hand, seemed terrified whenever he turned up in any scene. \n\nIn the overheard conversation with Snape in [Chapter Thirteen](https://www.wizardingworld.com/chapters/reading-nicolas-flamel), Quirrell may have been acting all terrified in Snape’s wake, but he was still asking Snape if he’d ‘found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s’ and was clearly potting alongside him. And then there was Snape confronting Quirrell about ‘where his loyalties lie’ – thinking back, this was a huge red flag about Quirrell that many of us misconstrued. \n\nAll the little signs about Quirrell were there, but with the far more naturally antagonistic Snape so often in the foreground, Quirrell was cleverly hidden in plain sight. But were you one of the readers who saw through him? \n\n                                ** \n\nSo, how about you? Did you see the plot twist in Philosopher’s Stone coming?

That’s as many points as Harry lost for sneaking out of bed in his first year at Hogwarts, the height of the dive he made to catch Neville’s Remembrall, the approximate number of witches and wizards on the Wizengamot. Phew... well... fifty is a lot of issues, so let’s take a moment to reflect and celebrate the Wizarding Weekly, and you, the fans, who have been reading and interacting with them through polls, watching videos, playing quizzes, reading articles and much more.\n\n## Some of your favourite film clips were...\n\n__1.__ “It’s all here in your head” - the moment Harry gets sorted into Gryffindor\n\n__2.__ Buckbeak’s flight from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \n\n__3.__ The Tale of the Three Brothers – the beautifully animated Beedle the Bard tale \n\n__4.__ Narcissa and Bellatrix in Spinner's End from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\n__5.__ “Farewell Aragog” - Slughorn and Hagrid get emotional at Aragog’s funeral \n\n## Some of your favourite articles were...\n\n__1.__ [The stories of the Hogwarts founders](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/stories-of-the-hogwarts-founders) \n\n__2.__ [What your Patronus says about you ](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/what-your-patronus-says-about-you)\n\n__3.__ [6 reasons to get excited if you’re in Ravenclaw](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/6-reasons-to-get-excited-if-youre-sorted-into-ravenclaw)\n\n__4.__ [6 reasons it’s great to get sorted into Slytherin](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/6-reasons-its-okay-if-you-get-sorted-into-slytherin)\n\n__5.__ [7 reasons it’s great to be sorted into Hufflepuff ](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/7-ways-hufflepuff-are-way-better-than-you-realise)\n\n## The five characters you learnt the most about were...\n\n__1.__ Luna Lovegood\n\n__2.__ Newt Scamander\n\n__3.__ Leta Lestrange\n\n__4.__ Scorpius Malfoy \n\n__5.__ Pomona Sprout \n\n## The five most popular polls you loved voting in... \n\n__1.__\tWho is the better Care of Magical Creatures professor? \n\n__2.__\tHow would you describe Narcissa Malfoy? \n\n__3.__\tWho was the worst DADA professor?\n\n__4.__\tWhich Hogwarts subject would be your favourite?\n\n__5.__\tIf you were an Animagus, which would you rather turn into?\n\n## And speaking of polls, here are some interesting poll results...\n\n__Our most popular poll ever is...__\n\n*“Who is the better Care of Magical Creatures Professor?”*\n\nYes, you all have extremely strong opinions on this particular profession at Hogwarts, as this was the poll that people have played the most in our humble app. And, of course, you all banded together to make sure that Hagrid was the winner across all four houses.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n__The character you would most like to channel in 2020 is...__\n\n*Hermione!*\n\nAt the start of this year, we asked you to pick a Wizarding World mascot to embrace in 2020, with the choice of Harry, Neville, Hermione or Draco. Hermione was the resounding winner across all four houses... although Draco nearly pipped her to the post for the Slytherins, with just 3% in it!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n__The Hogwarts gang you’d all most like to hang out with is...__ \n \n*The golden trio!*  \n \nWhen given the choice between the Marauders, the Golden Trio, Draco’s cronies and Ernie Macmillan’s gossipy Hufflepuffs, you voted in your thousands to proudly declare you’d like to be part of Harry Potter’s gang, alongside Ron and Hermione. Even the Hufflepuffs among you picked the golden trio over the characters in your house! However, there is an anomaly here – the Slytherins would much rather be managing mischief with the Marauders than Harry’s lot. Interesting! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n__You all think that Severus Snape was...__ \n \n*A hero.*  \n \nYes, in our Wizarding Weekly themed all around ‘heroes of the Dark Arts’, we received 20,000 votes on one of the biggest Harry Potter debates going: did you see Snape as a hero or a villain? Or... is the jury still out? The majority of you (around 60% at the time of writing) declared him to be a hero, collectively, with only around 7% dubbing him a villain, and the rest on the fence. No matter what house you’re in, this decision seems pretty unanimous too. But the debate will continue to wage on... Always...  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n__When asked if you’d rather be a Squib or a Muggle, you picked...__ \n \n*Squib! But only just.* \n \nThis is perhaps one of our closest polls yet, with 23,000 of you trying to decide which non-magical life you’d prefer. Pick a Squib, and you get to actually know about the wizarding world, see ghosts and get one of your wizard mates to pass you your cup of tea with the Summoning Charm. Pick a Muggle, and you can live in blissful ignorance without the frustration of not being able to perform magic. After all, you don’t know any better. \n\n \nBut when all is said and done, 51% of you (at the time of writing...) decided that being a Squib was the ever-so-slightly superior option. And you could always try the Kwikspell course, after all... \n \n***\n\n\nWe want to thank those of you who have joined us so far on our adventures re-visiting the wizarding world we all love. For those of you who joined us from the first issue of the Wizarding Weekly, thank you for accompanying us on our magical way.
